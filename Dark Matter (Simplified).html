<h2><span id="chapter-1">Chapter 1</span></h2>
<p>I love Thursday nights.</p>
<p>They have a feel to them that’s outside of time.</p>
<p>It’s our tradition, just the three of us—family night.</p>
<p>My son, Charlie, is sitting at the table, drawing on a sketch pad. He’s almost fifteen. The kid grew two inches over the summer, and he’s as tall as I am now.</p>
<p>I turn away from the onion I’m slicing, ask, “Can I see?”</p>
<p>He holds up the pad, shows me a mountain range that looks like something on another planet.</p>
<p>I say, “Love that. Just for fun?”</p>
<p>“Class project. Due tomorrow.”</p>
<p>“Then get back to it, Mr. Last Minute.”</p>
<p>Standing happy and slightly drunk in my kitchen, I’m unaware that tonight is the end of all of this. The end of everything I know, everything I love.</p>
<p>No one tells you it’s all about to change, to be taken away. There’s no warning, no sign that you’re standing on the edge. And maybe that’s what makes tragedy so sad. Not just what happens, but <em>how</em> it happens: a surprise hit that comes at you out of nowhere, when you’re least expecting it. No time to move or prepare.</p>
<p>The track lights shine on the surface of my wine, and the onion is beginning to sting my eyes. Thelonious Monk plays on the old record player in the den. There’s a richness to the old recording I can never get enough of, especially the crackle of noise between tracks. The den is filled with stacks and stacks of rare records that I keep telling myself I’ll get around to organizing one of these days.</p>
<p>My wife, Daniela, sits on the kitchen island, swirling her almost-empty wineglass in one hand and holding her phone in the other. She feels my stare and grins without looking up from the screen.</p>
<p>“I know,” she says. “I’m breaking the main rule of family night.”</p>
<p>“What’s so important?” I ask.</p>
<p>She puts her dark, Spanish eyes on mine. “Nothing.”</p>
<p>I walk over to her, take the phone softly out of her hand, and set it on the countertop.</p>
<p>“You could start the pasta,” I say.</p>
<p>“I prefer to watch <em>you</em> cook.”</p>
<p>“Yeah?” Quieter: “Turns you on, huh?”</p>
<p>“No, it’s just more fun to drink and do nothing.”</p>
<p>Her breath is wine-sweet, and she has one of those smiles that seem like they shouldn't exist. It still amazes me.</p>
<p>I finish my glass. “We should open more wine, right?”</p>
<p>“It would be silly not to.”</p>
<p>As I pull the cork from a new bottle, she picks her phone back up and shows me the screen. “I was reading <em>Chicago Magazine</em> ’s review of Marsha Altman’s show.”</p>
<p>“Were they kind?”</p>
<p>“Yeah, it’s basically a love letter.”</p>
<p>“Good for her.”</p>
<p>“I always thought…” She lets the sentence die, but I know where it was headed. Fifteen years ago, before we met, Daniela was a comer to Chicago’s art scene. She had a studio in Bucktown, showed her work in a half-dozen galleries, and had just lined up her first solo show in New York. Then came life. Me. Charlie. A bout of very bad depression after giving birth.</p>
<p>Derailment.</p>
<p>Now she teaches private art lessons to middle-grade students.</p>
<p>“It’s not that I’m not happy for her. I mean, she’s very smart, she deserves it all.”</p>
<p>I say, “If it makes you feel any better, Ryan Holder just won the Pavia Prize.”</p>
<p>“What’s that?”</p>
<p>“An award given for achievements in many areas of science. Ryan won for his work in the study of the brain.”</p>
<p>“Is it a big deal?”</p>
<p>“Million dollars. Praise. Opens the floodgates to grant money.”</p>
<p>“Hotter TAs?”</p>
<p>“Clearly that’s the real prize. He asked me to a small casual party tonight, but I refused.”</p>
<p>“Why?”</p>
<p>“Because it’s our night.”</p>
<p>“You should go.”</p>
<p>“I’d really rather not.”</p>
<p>Daniela lifts her empty glass. “So what you’re saying is, we both have good reason to drink a lot of wine tonight.”</p>
<p>I kiss her, and then pour a lot from the newly opened bottle.</p>
<p>“You could’ve won that prize,” Daniela says.</p>
<p>“You could’ve owned this city’s art scene.”</p>
<p>“But we did this.” She points at the high-ceilinged space of our brownstone. I bought it before Daniela with money left to me. “And we did that,” she says, pointing to Charlie as he draws with a beautiful focus that reminds me of Daniela when she’s deep in a painting.</p>
<p>It’s a strange thing, being the parent of a teenager. One thing to raise a little boy, another completely when a person about to be an adult looks to you for knowledge. I feel like I have little to give. I know there are fathers who see the world a certain way, with clearness and trust, who know just what to say to their sons and daughters. But I’m not one of them. The older I get, the less I understand. I love my son. He means everything to me. And yet, I can’t escape the feeling that I’m letting him down. Sending him off into the world with nothing but the small bits of my unsure view.</p>
<p>I move to the cabinet beside the sink, open it, and start looking for a box of fettuccine.</p>
<p>Daniela turns to Charlie, says, “Your father could have won the Nobel.”</p>
<p>I laugh. “That’s possibly an overstatement.”</p>
<p>“Charlie, don’t be tricked. He’s a genius.”</p>
<p>“You’re sweet,” I say. “And a little tipsy.”</p>
<p>“It’s true, and you know it. Science is less advanced because you love your family.”</p>
<p>I can only smile. When Daniela drinks, three things happen: her native accent begins to show, she becomes aggressively kind, and she tends toward exaggeration.</p>
<p>“Your father said to me one night—never forget it—that pure research is life-taking. He said…” For a moment, and to my surprise, feeling overtakes her. Her eyes get watery, and she shakes her head like she always does when she’s about to cry. At the last second, she recovers, pushes through. “He said, ‘Daniela, on my deathbed I would rather have memories of you than of a cold, empty lab.’ ”</p>
<p>I look at Charlie, catch him rolling his eyes as he sketches.</p>
<p>Probably embarrassed by our show of parental drama.</p>
<p>I stare into the cabinet and wait for the pain in my throat to go away.</p>
<p>When it does, I grab the pasta and close the door.</p>
<p>Daniela drinks her wine.</p>
<p>Charlie draws.</p>
<p>She just laughs, says, “Dinner will be on the table by the time you get home.”</p>
<p>“Which means I should be back here in…”</p>
<p>“Forty-five minutes.”</p>
<p>“What would I be without you?”</p>
<p>She kisses me.</p>
<p>“Let’s not even think about it.”</p>
<p>I grab my keys and wallet from the ceramic dish beside the microwave and move into the dining room, my gaze landing on the tesseract chandelier above the dinner table. Daniela gave it to me for our tenth wedding anniversary. Best gift ever.</p>
<p>As I reach the front door, Daniela shouts, “Return bringing ice cream!”</p>
<p>“Mint chocolate chip!” Charlie says.</p>
<p>I lift my arm, raise my thumb.</p>
<p>I don’t look back.</p>
<p>I don’t say goodbye.</p>
<p>And this moment slips past unnoticed.</p>
<p>The end of everything I know, everything I love.</p>
<p>—</p>
<p>I’ve lived in Logan Square for twenty years, and it doesn’t get any better than the first week of October. It always puts me in mind of that F. Scott Fitzgerald line: <em>Life starts all over again when it gets crisp in the fall.</em></p>
<p>The evening is cool, and the skies are clear enough to see a handful of stars. The bars are more lively than usual, packed with sad Cubs fans.</p>
<p>I stop on the sidewalk in the glow of a flashy sign that blinks VILLAGE TAP and stare through the open doorway of the common corner bar you’ll find in any good Chicago neighborhood. This one happens to be my local hangout. It’s the closest to home—a few blocks from my brownstone.</p>
<p>I pass through the glow of the blue neon sign in the front window and step through the doorway.</p>
<p>Matt, the bartender and owner, nods to me as I move down the bar, making my way through the crowd that surrounds Ryan Holder.</p>
<p>I say to Ryan, “I was just telling Daniela about you.”</p>
<p>He smiles, looking very well-kept for the lecture circuit—fit and tan in a black turtleneck, his facial hair carefully shaped.</p>
<p>“Wow is it good to see you. I’m touched that you came. Darling?” He touches the bare shoulder of the young woman sitting on the stool beside his. “Would you mind letting my dear old friend take your chair for a minute?”</p>
<p>The woman readily gives up her seat, and I climb onto the stool beside Ryan.</p>
<p>He calls the bartender over. “We want you to give us a pair of the most costly drinks in the house.”</p>
<p>“Ryan, not necessary.”</p>
<p>He grabs my arm. “We’re drinking the best tonight.”</p>
<p>Matt says, “I have Macallan Twenty-Five.”</p>
<p>“Doubles. My bill.”</p>
<p>When the bartender goes, Ryan hits me in the arm. Hard. You wouldn’t think of him as a scientist at first glance. He played lacrosse during his college years, and he still has the wide-shouldered body and easy movement of a natural athlete.</p>
<p>“How’s Charlie and the lovely Daniela?”</p>
<p>“They’re great.”</p>
<p>“You should’ve brought her down. I haven’t seen her since last Christmas.”</p>
<p>“She sends along her congrats.”</p>
<p>“You got a good woman there, but that’s not exactly news.”</p>
<p>“What are the chances of you settling down in the near future?”</p>
<p>“Small. The single life, and its many benefits, seems to fit me. You’re still at Lakemont College?”</p>
<p>“Yeah.”</p>
<p>“Decent school. Undergrad physics, right?”</p>
<p>“Exactly.”</p>
<p>“So you’re teaching…”</p>
<p>“Quantum mechanics. Basic stuff mainly. Nothing too terribly exciting.”</p>
<p>Matt returns with our drinks, and Ryan takes them out of his hands and sets mine before me.</p>
<p>“So this celebration…,” I say.</p>
<p>“Just a sudden thing a few of my postgrads threw together. They love nothing more than to get me drunk and talking.”</p>
<p>“Big year for you, Ryan. I still remember you almost failing differential equations.”</p>
<p>“And you helped me. More than once.”</p>
<p>For a second, behind the confidence and the smoothness, I glimpse the silly, fun-loving grad student with whom I shared a messy apartment for a year and a half.</p>
<p>I ask, “Was the Pavia Prize for your work in—”</p>
<p>“Finding the prefrontal cortex as a consciousness maker.”</p>
<p>“Right. Of course. I read your paper on it.”</p>
<p>“What’d you think?”</p>
<p>“Amazing.”</p>
<p>He looks genuinely pleased at the compliment.</p>
<p>“If I’m honest, Jason, and there’s no fake humbleness here, I always thought it would be you publishing the most important papers.”</p>
<p>“Really?”</p>
<p>He studies me over the top of his black plastic glass frames.</p>
<p>“Of course. You’re smarter than I am. Everyone knew it.”</p>
<p>I drink my whisky. I try not to acknowledge how delicious it is.</p>
<p>He says, “Just a question, but do you see yourself more as a research scientist or a teacher these days?”</p>
<p>“I—”</p>
<p>“Because I see myself, first and foremost, as a man searching for answers to basic questions. Now, if the people around me”—he gestures at his students who have begun to crowd in—“are smart enough to take in knowledge by just being near me…great. But the giving of knowledge, as it were, doesn’t interest me. All that matters is the science. The research.”</p>
<p>I note a flicker of annoyance, or anger, in his voice, and it’s building, like he’s getting himself worked up toward something.</p>
<p>I try to laugh it off. “Are you upset with me, Ryan? It almost sounds like you think I let you down.”</p>
<p>“Look, I’ve taught at MIT, Harvard, Johns Hopkins, the best schools on the planet. I’ve met the smartest people in the room, and Jason, you would’ve changed the world if you’d decided to go that path. If you’d stuck with it. Instead, you’re teaching undergrad physics to future doctors and patent lawyers.”</p>
<p>“We can’t all be superstars like you, Ryan.”</p>
<p>“Not if you quit.”</p>
<p>I finish my whisky.</p>
<p>“Well, I’m so glad I popped in for this.” I step down off the barstool.</p>
<p>“Don’t be that way, Jason. I was paying you a compliment.”</p>
<p>“I’m proud of you, man. I mean that.”</p>
<p>“Jason.”</p>
<p>“Thanks for the drink.”</p>
<p>Back outside, I walk down the sidewalk. The more distance I put between myself and Ryan, the angrier I become.</p>
<p>And I’m not even sure at whom.</p>
<p>My face is hot.</p>
<p>Lines of sweat trail down my sides.</p>
<p>Without thinking, I step into the street against a crosswalk signal and instantly hear the sound of tires locking up, of rubber screeching across pavement.</p>
<p>I turn and stare in disbelief as a yellow cab rushes toward me.</p>
<p>Through the approaching windshield, I see the cabbie so clearly—a mustached man, wide-eyed with obvious panic, bracing for impact.</p>
<p>And then my hands are flat against the warm, yellow metal of the hood and the cabbie is leaning out his window, yelling at me, “You dipshit, you almost died! Pull your head out of your ass!”</p>
<p>Horns begin to blare behind the cab.</p>
<p>I go back to the sidewalk and watch the flow of traffic resume.</p>
<p>The occupants of three separate cars are kind enough to slow down so they can flip me off.</p>
<p>—</p>
<p>Whole Foods smells like the hippie I dated before Daniela—a mix of fresh produce, ground coffee, and essential oils.</p>
<p>The scare with the cab has ruined my mood, and I look at the freezer cases in something of a fog, tired and sleepy.</p>
<p>It feels colder when I’m back outside, a strong wind blowing in off the lake, suggesting the bad winter that is coming very soon.</p>
<p>With my canvas bag filled with ice cream, I take a different route toward home. It adds six blocks, but what I lose in shortness, I gain in being alone, and between the cab and Ryan, I need some extra time to calm down.</p>
<p>I pass a building site, not being worked on for the night, and a few blocks later, the playground of the grade school my son went to, the metal sliding board shining under a streetlamp and the swings moving in the breeze.</p>
<p>There’s a feeling to these fall nights that touches something basic inside of me. Something from a long time ago. From my childhood in western Iowa. I think of high school football games and the stadium lights shining down on the players. I smell ripening apples, and the sour smell of beer from keg parties in the cornfields. I feel the wind in my face as I ride in the back of an old pickup truck down a country road at night, dust swirling red in the taillights and the entire span of my life opening out ahead of me.</p>
<p>It’s the great thing about being young.</p>
<p>There’s a feeling of no weight that fills everything because no bad choices have been made, no paths decided on, and the road forking out ahead is pure, unlimited possibility.</p>
<p>I love my life, but I haven’t felt that lightness in a long time. Fall nights like this are as close as I get.</p>
<p>The cold is beginning to clear my head.</p>
<p>It will be good to be home again. I’m thinking of starting up the gas logs. We’ve never had a fire before Halloween, but tonight is so unusually cold that after walking a mile in this wind, all I want is to sit by the fire with Daniela and Charlie and a glass of wine.</p>
<p>The street goes under the El.</p>
<p>I pass under the rusting metal of the railway.</p>
<p>For me, even more than the skyline, the El is a symbol of the city.</p>
<p>This is my favorite section of the walk home, because it’s the darkest and quietest.</p>
<p>At the moment…</p>
<p>No trains coming in.</p>
<p>No headlights in either direction.</p>
<p>No sound of a pub.</p>
<p>Nothing but the far-off roar of a jet overhead, coming in to land at O’Hare.</p>
<p>Wait…</p>
<p>There’s something coming—steps on the sidewalk.</p>
<p>I look back.</p>
<p>A shadow runs toward me, the distance between us getting smaller faster than I can understand what’s happening.</p>
<p>The first thing I see is a face.</p>
<p>Pale white.</p>
<p>High, curved eyebrows that look drawn.</p>
<p>Red, tight lips—too thin, too perfect.</p>
<p>And scary eyes—big and pitch-black, without pupils or irises.</p>
<p>The second thing I see is the barrel of a gun, four inches from the end of my nose.</p>
<p>The low, rough voice behind the geisha mask says, “Turn around.”</p>
<p>I pause, too shocked to move.</p>
<p>He pushes the gun into my face.</p>
<p>I turn around.</p>
<p>Before I can tell him that my wallet is in my front left pocket, he says, “I’m not here for your money. Start walking.”</p>
<p>I start walking.</p>
<p>“Faster.”</p>
<p>I walk faster.</p>
<p>“What do you want?” I ask.</p>
<p>“Keep your mouth shut.”</p>
<p>A train roars past overhead, and we emerge from the darkness under the El, my heart jumping inside my chest. I take in my surroundings with a sudden and deep interest. Across the street is a gated townhome complex, and this side of the block has a group of businesses that close at five.</p>
<p>A nail salon.</p>
<p>A law office.</p>
<p>An appliance fix shop.</p>
<p>A tire store.</p>
<p>This neighborhood is a ghost town, nobody out.</p>
<p>“See that SUV?” he asks. There’s a black Lincoln Navigator parked on the curb just ahead. The alarm beeps. “Get in the driver’s seat.”</p>
<p>“Whatever you’re thinking about doing—”</p>
<p>“Or you can bleed to death right here on the sidewalk.”</p>
<p>I open the driver’s-side door and slide in behind the wheel.</p>
<p>“My grocery bag,” I say.</p>
<p>“Bring it.” He climbs in behind me. “Start the car.”</p>
<p>I pull the door closed and put the canvas Whole Foods bag in the front passenger floorboard. It’s so quiet in the car I can actually hear my pulse—a fast beating against my eardrum.</p>
<p>“What are you waiting for?” he asks.</p>
<p>I press the engine-start button.</p>
<p>“Turn on the navigation.”</p>
<p>I turn it on.</p>
<p>“Click on ‘past places.’ ”</p>
<p>I’ve never owned a car with built-in GPS, and it takes me a moment to find the right tab on the screen.</p>
<p>Three locations appear.</p>
<p>One is my home address. One is the university where I work.</p>
<p>“You’ve been following me?” I ask.</p>
<p>“Choose Pulaski Drive.”</p>
<p>I select 1400 Pulaski Drive, Chicago, Illinois 60616, with no idea where that even is. The female voice on the GPS tells me: <em>Make a legal U-turn when possible and go for point-eight miles.</em></p>
<p>Shifting into gear, I turn out into the dark street.</p>
<p>The man behind me says, “Buckle your seat belt.”</p>
<p>I strap myself in as he does the same.</p>
<p>“Jason, just so we’re clear, if you do anything other than follow these directions exactly, I’m going to shoot you through the seat. Do you understand what I’m telling you?”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>I drive us through my neighborhood, wondering if I’m seeing it all for the last time.</p>
<p>At a red light, I pull to a stop in front of my corner bar. Through the deeply tinted front passenger window, I see the door is still propped open. I glimpse Matt, and through the crowd, Ryan, turned around in his stool now, his back to the bar, his elbows on the scuffed wood, holding court for his postgrads. Probably thrilling them with a scary story of failure starring his old roommate.</p>
<p>I want to call out to him. To make him understand that I’m in trouble. That I need—</p>
<p>“Green light, Jason.”</p>
<p>I accelerate through the intersection.</p>
<p>The GPS navigation guides us east through Logan Square to the Kennedy Expressway, where the indifferent female voice tells me, <em>Turn right in one hundred feet and go for nineteen-point-eight miles.</em></p>
<p>Southbound traffic is light enough for me to set the speedometer at seventy and keep it there. My hands sweat on the leather steering wheel, and I can’t stop wondering, Am I going to die tonight?</p>
<p>It occurs to me that if I do survive, I’ll carry a new understanding with me for the rest of my days: we leave this life the same way we enter it—totally alone, without help. I’m afraid, and there is nothing Daniela or Charlie or anyone can do to help me in this moment when I need them more than ever. They don’t even know what I’m experiencing.</p>
<p>The interstate goes around the western edge of downtown. The Willis Tower and its group of smaller skyscrapers shine with a calm warmth against the night.</p>
<p>Through the twisting panic and fear, my mind races, fighting to figure out what’s happening.</p>
<p>My address is in the GPS. So this wasn’t a chance meeting. This man has been following me. Knows me. So, some action of mine has resulted in this outcome.</p>
<p>But which?</p>
<p>I’m not rich.</p>
<p>My life isn’t worth anything beyond its value to me and to my loved ones.</p>
<p>I’ve never been arrested, never committed a crime.</p>
<p>Never slept with another man’s wife.</p>
<p>Sure, I flip people off in traffic sometimes, but that’s just Chicago.</p>
<p>My last and only physical fight was in the sixth grade when I punched a classmate in the nose for pouring milk down the back of my shirt.</p>
<p>I haven’t hurt anyone in the important sense of the word. In a way that might have ended with me driving a Lincoln Navigator with a gun pointed at the back of my head.</p>
<p>I’m an atomic physicist and professor at a small college.</p>
<p>I don’t treat my students, even the worst of the bunch, with anything but respect. Those who have failed out of my classes failed because they didn’t care in the first place, and certainly none of them could accuse me of ruining their lives. I go <em>out of my</em> <em>way</em> to help my students pass.</p>
<p>The skyline gets smaller in the side mirror, falling farther and farther away like a familiar and comforting piece of coastline.</p>
<p>I say, “Did I do something to you in the past? Or someone you work for? I just don’t understand what you could possibly want from—”</p>
<p>“The more you talk, the worse it will be for you.”</p>
<p>For the first time, I realize there’s something familiar in his voice. I can’t for the life of me figure out when or where, but we’ve met. I’m sure of it.</p>
<p>I feel the shaking of my phone getting a text message.</p>
<p>Then another.</p>
<p>And another.</p>
<p>He forgot to take my phone.</p>
<p>I look at the time: 9:05 p.m.</p>
<p>I left my house a little over an hour ago. It’s Daniela no doubt, wondering where I am. I’m fifteen minutes late, and I’m never late.</p>
<p>I look in the rearview mirror, but it’s too dark to see anything except a sliver of the ghost-white mask. I try something. Taking my left hand off the steering wheel, I place it in my lap and count to ten.</p>
<p>He says nothing.</p>
<p>I put my hand back on the wheel.</p>
<p>That computerized voice breaks the silence: <em>Merge right onto the Eighty-Seventh Street exit in four-point-three miles.</em></p>
<p>Again, I take my left hand slowly off the wheel.</p>
<p>This time, I slide it into the pocket of my tan pants. My phone is buried deep, and I just barely touch it with my first and second fingers, somehow managing to pinch it between them.</p>
<p>Little by little, I pull it out, the rubber cover catching on every fold of cloth, and now a constant shaking rattling between my fingertips—a call coming in.</p>
<p>When I finally work it free, I place my phone faceup in my lap and return my hand to the steering wheel.</p>
<p>As the navigation voice updates the distance from our upcoming turn, I shoot a glance down at the phone.</p>
<p>There’s a missed call from “Dani” and three texts:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>DANI 2m ago</p>
<p>Dinner’s on the table</p>
<p>DANI 2m ago</p>
<p>Hurry home we are STARVING!</p>
<p>DANI 1m ago
</p>
<p>You get lost? :)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I focus my attention on the road, wondering if the light from my phone is visible from the backseat.</p>
<p>The screen goes dark.</p>
<p>Reaching down, I press the ON/OFF button and swipe the screen. I type in my four-digit code, press the green “Messages” icon. Daniela’s chat is at the top, and as I open our talk, my kidnapper moves behind me.</p>
<p>I grab the wheel with both hands again.</p>
<p><em>Merge right onto the Eighty-Seventh Street exit in one-point-nine miles.</em></p>
<p>The screensaver times out, auto-lock starts, my phone goes black.</p>
<p>Shit.</p>
<p>Sliding my hand back down, I retype the code and begin typing out the most important text of my life, my finger clumsy on the screen, each word taking two or three tries to complete as auto-correct messes things up.</p>
<p>The barrel of the gun pushes into the back of my head.</p>
<p>I react, turning into the fast lane.</p>
<p>“What are you doing, Jason?”</p>
<p>I straighten the wheel with one hand, moving us back into the slow lane as my other hand lowers toward the phone, getting close to Send.</p>
<p>He jumps between the front seats, his gloved hand reaching around my waist, taking the phone away.</p>
<p><em>Merge right onto the Eighty-Seventh Street exit in five hundred feet.</em></p>
<p>“What’s your passcode, Jason?” When I don’t respond, he says, “Wait. I bet I know this. Month and year of your birthday backwards? Let’s see…three-seven-two-one. There we go.”</p>
<p>In the rearview mirror, I see the phone light up his mask.</p>
<p>He reads the text he stopped me from sending: “ ‘1400 Pulaski call 91…’ Bad boy.”</p>
<p>I turn onto the interstate off-ramp.</p>
<p>The GPS says, <em>Turn left onto Eighty-Seventh Street and go east for three-point-eight miles.</em></p>
<p>We drive into South Chicago, through a neighborhood we have no reason to be in.</p>
<p>Past rows of factory homes.</p>
<p>Apartment buildings.</p>
<p>Empty parks with rusted swing sets and basketball hoops without nets.</p>
<p>Shops locked up for the night behind security gates.</p>
<p>Gang writing everywhere.</p>
<p>He asks, “So do you call her Dani or Daniela?”</p>
<p>My throat tightens.</p>
<p>Anger and worry and weakness growing inside of me.</p>
<p>“Jason, I asked you a question.”</p>
<p>“Go to hell.”</p>
<p>He leans close, his words hot in my ear. “You do not want to go down this road with me. I will hurt you worse than you’ve ever been hurt in your life. Pain you didn’t even know was possible. What do you call her?”</p>
<p>I clench my teeth. “Daniela.”</p>
<p>“Never Dani? Even though that’s what’s on your phone?”</p>
<p>I’m tempted to flip the car at high speed and just kill us both.</p>
<p>I say, “Rarely. She doesn’t like it.”</p>
<p>“What’s in the grocery bag?”</p>
<p>“Why do you want to know what I call her?”</p>
<p>“What’s in the bag?”</p>
<p>“Ice cream.”</p>
<p>“It’s family night, right?”</p>
<p>“Yeah.”</p>
<p>In the rearview mirror, I see him typing on my phone.</p>
<p>“What are you writing?” I ask.</p>
<p>He doesn’t respond.</p>
<p>We’re out of the poor area now, riding through a empty place that doesn’t even feel like Chicago anymore, with the skyline nothing but a smear of light on the far horizon. The houses are falling apart, dark, and lifeless. Everything long left behind.</p>
<p>We cross a river and straight ahead lies Lake Michigan, its black space a fitting end of this city emptiness.</p>
<p>As if the world ends right here.</p>
<p>And perhaps mine does.</p>
<p><em>Turn right and go south on Pulaski Drive for half a mile to destination.</em></p>
<p>He laughs to himself. “Wow, are you in trouble with the wife.” I squeeze the steering wheel. “Who was that man you had whisky with tonight, Jason? I couldn’t tell from outside.”</p>
<p>It’s so dark out here in this borderland between Chicago and Indiana.</p>
<p>We’re passing the remains of railroad yards and factories.</p>
<p>“Jason.”</p>
<p>“His name is Ryan Holder. He used to be—”</p>
<p>“Your old roommate.”</p>
<p>“How’d you know that?”</p>
<p>“Are you two close? I don’t see him in your contacts.”</p>
<p>“Not really. How do you—?”</p>
<p>“I know almost everything about you, Jason. You could say I’ve made your life my focus.”</p>
<p>“Who are you?”</p>
<p><em>You will arrive at your destination in five hundred feet.</em></p>
<p>“Who <em>are</em> you?”</p>
<p>He doesn’t answer, but my attention is beginning to pull away from him as I focus on our increasingly far away surroundings.</p>
<p>The pavement flows under the SUV’s headlights.</p>
<p>Empty behind us.</p>
<p>Empty ahead.</p>
<p>There’s the lake off to my left, deserted warehouses on my right.</p>
<p><em>You have arrived at your destination.</em></p>
<p>I stop the Navigator in the middle of the road.</p>
<p>He says, “The entrance is up ahead on the left.”</p>
<p>The headlights touch a shaky stretch of twelve-foot fencing, topped with a crown of rusted barbed wire. The gate is ajar, and a chain that once locked it shut has been cut and coiled in the weeds by the roadside.</p>
<p>“Just push the gate with the front bumper.”</p>
<p>Even from inside the nearly silent interior of the SUV, the screech of the gate grinding open is loud. The cones of light show the remains of a road, the pavement cracked and bent from years of harsh Chicago winters.</p>
<p>I engage the high beams.</p>
<p>Light washes over a parking lot, where streetlamps have fallen everywhere like spilled matchsticks.</p>
<p>Beyond, a large building looms.</p>
<p>The brick front of the old building is beside huge round tanks and a pair of hundred-foot smokestacks going into the sky.</p>
<p>“What is this place?” I ask.</p>
<p>“Put it in PARK and turn it off.”</p>
<p>I bring the car to a stop, shift out of gear, and punch off the engine.</p>
<p>It becomes very silent.</p>
<p>“What is this place?” I ask again.</p>
<p>“What are your Friday plans?”</p>
<p>“Excuse me?”</p>
<p>A sharp hit to the side of my head sends me falling into the steering wheel, shocked and wondering for a half second if this is what it feels like to be shot in the head.</p>
<p>But no, he only hit me with his gun.</p>
<p>I touch my hand to the point of the hit.</p>
<p>I realize that I see the interior of the Navigator as a kind of lifeboat. As long as I stay inside, he can’t really hurt me.</p>
<p>He won’t make a mess in here.</p>
<p>“Jason.”</p>
<p>My chest is heaving, I’m starting to breathe fast, black spots exploding across my view.</p>
<p>“I know what you’re thinking,” he says, “and I can hurt you just as easily inside this car.”</p>
<p>I’m not getting enough air. I’m starting to panic.</p>
<p>But I manage to say, breathlessly, “Nonsense. You don’t want my blood in here.”</p>
<p>—</p>
<p>When I wake up, he’s pulling me out of the front seat by my arms. He drops me in the gravel, where I sit confused, waiting for my head to clear.</p>
<p>It’s always colder near the lake, and tonight is no exception. The wind gives a sharp, jagged bite on my exposed skin, which is covered in gooseflesh.</p>
<p>It’s so dark out here I can see five times the number of stars as in the city.</p>
<p>My head is pounding, and a fresh line of blood runs down the side of my face. But with a full load of adrenaline rushing through my system, the pain is quiet.</p>
<p>He drops a flashlight in the dirt beside me and shines his at the falling-apart building I saw as we drove in. “After you.”</p>
<p>I clutch the light in my hand and struggle to my feet. Stumbling toward the building, my bare feet trample wet newspaper. I dodge crumpled beer cans and lines of glass that shine under the beam.</p>
<p>Approaching the main entrance, I imagine this empty parking lot on another night. A night to come. It’s early winter, and through a curtain of falling snow, the darkness is striped with flashing blues and reds. Detectives and cadaver dogs swarm the ruins, and as they examine my body somewhere inside, naked and decayed and cut up, a patrol car parks in front of my brownstone in Logan Square. It’s two in the morning, and Daniela comes to the door in a nightgown. I’ve been missing for weeks and she knows in her heart I’m not coming back, thinks she’s already made her peace with that harsh fact, but seeing these young police officers with their hard, serious eyes and a dusting of snow on their shoulders and visored caps, which they hold respectfully under their arms…it all finally breaks something inside of her she didn’t know was still whole. She feels her knees weaken, her strength giving way, and as she sinks onto the doormat, Charlie comes down the creaky staircase behind her, sleepy-eyed and messy-haired, asking, “Is it about Dad?”</p>
<p>As we close in on the structure, two words show themselves on the faded brick above the entrance. The only letters I can make out spell CAGO POWER.</p>
<p>He forces me through an opening in the brick.</p>
<p>Our light beams sweep across a front office.</p>
<p>Furniture ruined down to the metal frames.</p>
<p>An old water cooler.</p>
<p>The leftovers of someone’s campfire.</p>
<p>A torn sleeping bag.</p>
<p>Used condoms on moldy carpet.</p>
<p>We enter a long corridor.</p>
<p>Without the flashlights, this would be can’t-see-your-hand-in-front-of-your-face dark.</p>
<p>I stop to shine my light ahead, but it’s swallowed by the darkness. There’s less junk on the twisted linoleum floor beneath my feet, and no sound whatsoever, save for the low, far-off moan of wind outside these walls.</p>
<p>I’m growing colder by the second.</p>
<p>He jams the barrel of the gun into my kidney, forcing me on.</p>
<p>At some point, did I fall onto the radar of a crazy person who decided to learn everything about me before he killed me? I often talk with strangers. Maybe we spoke briefly in that coffee shop near campus. Or on the El. Or over beers at my corner bar.</p>
<p>Does he have plans for Charlie and Daniela?</p>
<p>“Do you want to hear me plead?” I ask, my voice beginning to break. “Because I will. I’ll do anything you want.”</p>
<p>And the horrible thing is that it’s true. I would disgrace myself. Hurt someone else, do almost anything if he would only take me back to my neighborhood and let this night continue like it was supposed to—with me walking home to my family, bringing them the ice cream I’d promised.</p>
<p>“If what?” he asks. “If I let you go?”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>The sound of his laughter bounces down the corridor. “I’d be afraid to see what-all you’d be willing to do to get yourself out of this.”</p>
<p>“Out of what, exactly?”</p>
<p>But he doesn’t answer.</p>
<p>I fall to my knees.</p>
<p>My light goes sliding across the floor.</p>
<p>“Please,” I beg. “You don’t have to do this.” I barely recognize my own voice. “You can just walk away. I don’t know why you want to hurt me, but just think about it for a minute. I—”</p>
<p>“Jason.”</p>
<p>“—love my family. I love my wife. I love—”</p>
<p>“Jason.”</p>
<p>“—my son.”</p>
<p>“Jason!”</p>
<p>“I will do <em>anything</em>.”</p>
<p>I’m shaking now—from cold, from fear.</p>
<p>He kicks me in the stomach, and as the breath explodes out of my lungs, I roll over onto my back. Crushing down on top of me, he shoves the barrel of the gun between my lips, into my mouth, all the way to the back of my throat until the taste of old oil and carbon dirt is more than I can stomach.</p>
<p>Two seconds before I throw up the night’s wine and Scotch across the floor, he takes out the gun.</p>
<p>Screams, “Get up!”</p>
<p>He grabs my arm, jerks me back onto my feet.</p>
<p>Pointing the gun in my face, he puts my flashlight back into my hands.</p>
<p>I stare into the mask, my light shining on the weapon.</p>
<p>It’s my first good look at the gun. I know almost nothing about firearms, only that it’s a handgun, has a hammer, a cylinder, and a giant hole at the end of the barrel that looks fully able to deliver my death. The light of my flashlight gives a bit of copper to the point of the bullet aimed at my face. For some reason, I picture this man in a single-room apartment, loading rounds into the cylinder, preparing to do what he’s done.</p>
<p>I’m going to die here, maybe right now.</p>
<p>Every moment feels like it could be the end.</p>
<p>“Move,” he growls.</p>
<p>I start walking.</p>
<p>We arrive at a crossing and turn down a different hallway, this one wider, taller, arched. The air is heavy with moisture. I hear the distant <em>drip…drip…drip</em> of falling water. The walls are made of concrete, and instead of linoleum, the floor is covered with wet moss that grows thicker and wetter with each step.</p>
<p>The taste of the gun stays in my mouth, mixed with the sour tang of bile.</p>
<p>Parts of my face are growing numb from the cold.</p>
<p>A small voice in my head is yelling at me to do something, try something, anything. Don’t just be led like a lamb to slaughter, one foot obediently following the other. Why make it so easy for him?</p>
<p>Easy.</p>
<p>Because I’m scared.</p>
<p>So scared I can barely walk straight.</p>
<p>And my thoughts are broken and crowded.</p>
<p>I understand now why victims don’t fight back. I cannot imagine trying to beat this man. Trying to run.</p>
<p>And here’s the most shameful truth: there’s a part of me that would rather just have it all be over, because the dead don’t feel fear or pain. Does this mean I’m a scaredy-cat? Is that the final truth I have to face before I die?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>I have to do something.</p>
<p>We step out of the tunnel onto a metal surface that’s freezing against the bottoms of my feet. I grab a rusty iron railing that goes around a platform. It’s colder here, and the sense of open space is clear.</p>
<p>As if on a timer, a yellow moon creeps up on Lake Michigan, slowly rising.</p>
<p>Its light streams through the upper windows of a big room, and it’s bright enough in here for me to see everything by myself without the flashlight.</p>
<p>My stomach turns.</p>
<p>We’re standing on the high point of an open staircase that drops fifty feet.</p>
<p>It looks like an oil painting in here, the way the old light falls on a row of sleeping machines below and the crisscross of metal beams overhead.</p>
<p>It’s as quiet as a church.</p>
<p>“We’re going down,” he says. “Watch your step.”</p>
<p>We go down.</p>
<p>Two steps up from the second-to-highest landing, I turn with the flashlight gripped tightly in my right hand, aiming for his head…</p>
<p>…and hitting nothing, the force carrying me right back to where I started and then some.</p>
<p>I’m unsteady, falling.</p>
<p>I hit the landing hard, and the flashlight jumps out of my hand and disappears over the edge.</p>
<p>A second later, I hear it smash on the floor forty feet below.</p>
<p>My captor stares down at me behind that blank mask, head tilted, gun pointed at my face.</p>
<p>Pulling back the hammer, he steps toward me.</p>
<p>I groan as his knee hits into my chest, holding me to the landing.</p>
<p>The gun touches my head.</p>
<p>He says, “I have to admit, I’m proud you tried. It was sad. I saw it coming a mile away, but at least you went down swinging.”</p>
<p>I pull back against a sharp sting in the side of my neck.</p>
<p>“Don’t fight it,” he says.</p>
<p>“What did you give me?”</p>
<p>Before he can answer, something rushes through my blood-brain barrier like a big truck. I feel very heavy and light all at once, the world spinning and turning itself inside out.</p>
<p>And then, as fast as it hit me, it passes.</p>
<p>Another needle stabs into my leg.</p>
<p>As I cry out, he throws both syringes over the edge. “Let’s go.”</p>
<p>“What did you give me?”</p>
<p>“Get up!”</p>
<p>I use the railing to pull myself up. My knee is bleeding from the fall. My head is still bleeding. I’m cold, dirty, and wet, my teeth chattering so hard it feels like they might break.</p>
<p>We go down, the weak steelwork shaking with our weight. At the bottom, we move off the last step and walk down a row of old generators.</p>
<p>From the floor, this room seems even more huge.</p>
<p>At the middle, he stops and shines his flashlight on a duffel bag placed against one of the generators.</p>
<p>“New clothes. Hurry up.”</p>
<p>“New clothes? I don’t—”</p>
<p>“You don’t have to understand. You just have to get dressed.”</p>
<p>Through all the fear, I notice a little bit of hope. Is he going to let me go? Why else would he be making me get dressed? Do I have a chance at living through this?</p>
<p>“Who are you?” I ask.</p>
<p>“Hurry up. You don’t have much time left.”</p>
<p>I squat by the duffel bag.</p>
<p>“Clean yourself up first.”</p>
<p>There’s a towel on top, which I use to wipe the mud off my feet, the blood off my knee and face. I pull on a pair of underwear and jeans that fit perfectly. Whatever he injected me with, I think I can feel it in my fingers now—a loss of skill as I struggle with the buttons on a plaid shirt. My feet slide easily into a pair of costly leather slip-ons. They fit as comfortably as the jeans.</p>
<p>I’m not cold anymore. It’s like there’s a center of heat in the middle of my chest, sending out through my arms and legs.</p>
<p>“The jacket too.”</p>
<p>I lift a black leather jacket from the bottom of the bag, push my arms through the sleeves.</p>
<p>“Perfect,” he says. “Now, have a seat.”</p>
<p>I ease down against the iron base of the generator. It’s a huge piece of machinery the size of a train engine.</p>
<p>He sits across from me, the gun pointed casually in my direction.</p>
<p>Moonlight is filling this place, bouncing off the broken windows high above and sending a scatter of light that hits—</p>
<p>Tangles of cable.</p>
<p>Gears.</p>
<p>Pipes.</p>
<p>Levers and pulleys.</p>
<p>Instrumentation panels covered with broken gauges and controls.</p>
<p>Technology from another time.</p>
<p>I ask, “What happens now?”</p>
<p>“We wait.”</p>
<p>“For what?”</p>
<p>He waves my question away.</p>
<p>A strange calm settles over me. A misplaced sense of peace.</p>
<p>“Did you bring me here to kill me?” I ask.</p>
<p>“I did not.”</p>
<p>I feel so comfortable leaning against the old machine, like I’m sinking into it.</p>
<p>“But you let me believe it.”</p>
<p>“There was no other way.”</p>
<p>“No other way to what?”</p>
<p>“To get you here.”</p>
<p>“And why are we here?”</p>
<p>But he just shakes his head as he snakes his left hand up under the geisha mask and scratches.</p>
<p>I feel strange.</p>
<p>Like I’m at the same time watching a movie and acting in it.</p>
<p>An overwhelming sleepiness lowers onto my shoulders.</p>
<p>My head dips.</p>
<p>“Just let it take you,” he says.</p>
<p>But I don’t. I fight it, thinking how strangely fast his voice has changed. He’s like a different man, and the gap between who he is in this moment and the violence he showed just minutes ago should scare me. I shouldn’t be this calm, but my body is humming too peacefully.</p>
<p>I feel very calm and deep and far away.</p>
<p>He says to me, almost like a secret, “It’s been a long journey. I can’t quite believe I’m sitting here actually looking at you. Talking to you. I know you don’t understand, but there’s so much I want to ask.”</p>
<p>“About what?”</p>
<p>“What it’s like to be you.”</p>
<p>“What do you mean?”</p>
<p>He hesitates, then: “How do you feel about your place in the world, Jason?”</p>
<p>I say slowly, carefully, “That’s an interesting question considering the night you’ve put me through.”</p>
<p>“Are you happy in your life?”</p>
<p>In the shadow of this moment, my life is very beautiful.</p>
<p>“I have an amazing family. A good job. We’re comfortable. Nobody’s sick.”</p>
<p>My tongue feels thick. My words are beginning to sound unclear.</p>
<p>“But?”</p>
<p>I say, “My life is great. It’s just not special. And there was a time when it could have been.”</p>
<p>“You ended your ambition, didn’t you?”</p>
<p>“It died naturally. Of neglect.”</p>
<p>“And do you know exactly how that happened? Was there a moment when—?”</p>
<p>“My son. I was twenty-seven years old, and Daniela and I had been together a few months. She told me she was pregnant. We were having fun, but it wasn’t love. Or maybe it was. I don’t know. We definitely weren’t looking to start a family.”</p>
<p>“But you did.”</p>
<p>“When you’re a scientist, your late twenties are so important. If you don’t publish something big by thirty, they put you out to pasture.”</p>
<p>Maybe it’s just the drug, but it feels so good to be talking. An oasis of normal after two of the craziest hours I’ve ever lived. I know it isn’t true, but it feels like as long as we keep talking, nothing bad can happen. As if the words protect me.</p>
<p>“Did you have something big in the works?” he asks.</p>
<p>Now I’m having to focus on making my eyes stay open.</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>“And what was it?”</p>
<p>His voice sounds distant.</p>
<p>“I was trying to create the quantum mix of an object that was visible to the human eye.”</p>
<p>“Why did you stop your research?”</p>
<p>“When Charlie was born, he had major medical problems for the first year of his life. I needed a thousand hours in a cleanroom, but I couldn’t get there fast enough. Daniela needed me. My son needed me. I lost my money. Lost my pace. I was the young, new genius for a minute, but when I slipped, someone else took my place.”</p>
<p>“Do you regret your choice to stay with Daniela and make a life with her?”</p>
<p>“No.”</p>
<p>“Never?”</p>
<p>I think of Daniela, and the emotion breaks back through, accompanied by the actual horror of the moment. Fear returns, and with it a homesickness that cuts to the bone. I <em>need</em> her in this moment more than I’ve ever needed anything in my life.</p>
<p>“Never.”</p>
<p>And then I’m lying on the floor, my face against the cold concrete, and the drug is whisking me away.</p>
<p>He’s kneeling beside me now, rolling me onto my back, and I’m looking up at all that moonlight pouring in through the high windows of this forgotten place, the darkness wrinkled with twitches of light and color as swirling, empty voids open and close beside the generators.</p>
<p>“Will I see her again?” I ask.</p>
<p>“I don’t know.”</p>
<p>I want to ask him for the millionth time what he wants with me, but I can’t find the words.</p>
<p>My eyes keep closing, and I try to hold them open, but it’s a losing battle.</p>
<p>He pulls off a glove and touches my face with his bare hand.</p>
<p>Strangely.</p>
<p>Gently.</p>
<p>He says, “Listen to me. You’re going to be scared, but you can make it yours. You can have everything you never had. I’m sorry I had to scare you earlier, but I had to get you here. I’m so sorry, Jason. I’m doing this for both of us.”</p>
<p>I mouth the words, <em>Who are you?</em></p>
<p>Instead of responding, he reaches into his pocket and takes out a new needle and a tiny glass container filled with a clear liquid that in the moonlight shines like mercury.</p>
<p>He opens the needle and pulls the contents of the vial up into the needle.</p>
<p>As my eyelids slowly lower, I watch him slide the sleeve up his left arm and inject himself.</p>
<p>Then he drops the container and the needle on the concrete between us, and the last thing I see before my eyes lock shut is that glass container rolling toward my face.</p>
<p>I whisper, “Now what?”</p>
<p>And he says, “You wouldn’t believe me if I told you.”</p>
<h2><span id="chapter-2">Chapter 2</span></h2>
<p>I’m aware of someone holding my ankles.</p>
<p>As hands slide under my shoulders, a woman says, “How’d he get out of the box?”</p>
<p>A man responds: “No idea. Look, he’s waking up.”</p>
<p>I open my eyes, but all I see is blurry movement and light.</p>
<p>The man yells, “Let’s get him the hell out of here.”</p>
<p>I try to speak, but the words fall out of my mouth, mumbled and unclear.</p>
<p>The woman says, “Dr. Dessen? Can you hear me? We’re going to lift you onto a stretcher now.”</p>
<p>I look toward my feet, and the man’s face becomes clear. He’s staring at me through the face shield of a shiny protective suit with a breathing mask.</p>
<p>Looking at the woman behind my head, he says, “One, two, three.”</p>
<p>They lift me onto a stretcher and lock soft straps around my ankles and wrists.</p>
<p>“Only for <em>your</em> safety, Dr. Dessen.”</p>
<p>I watch the ceiling move past, forty or fifty feet above.</p>
<p>Where the hell am I? A big garage?</p>
<p>I catch a glint of memory—a needle piercing my neck. I was injected with something. This is some crazy dream.</p>
<p>A radio squawks, “Removal team, report. Over.”</p>
<p>The woman says with excitement showing in her voice, “We have Dessen. We’re on the way. Over.”</p>
<p>I hear the squeak of wheels rolling.</p>
<p>“Copy that. First condition check? Over.”</p>
<p>She reaches down with a gloved hand and wakes some kind of monitoring device that’s been stuck to my left arm.</p>
<p>“Heart rate: one-fifteen. Blood pressure: one-forty over ninety-two. Temp: ninety-eight-point-nine. Oxygen level: ninety-five percent. Gamma: point-eight seven. ETA thirty seconds. Out.”</p>
<p>A buzzing sound startles me.</p>
<p>We move through a pair of heavy doors that are slowly opening.</p>
<p>Jesus Christ.</p>
<p><em>Stay calm. This isn’t real.</em></p>
<p>The wheels squeak faster, more quickly.</p>
<p>We’re in a hallway lined with plastic, my eyes squinting against the lot of light from bright bulbs shining overhead.</p>
<p>The doors behind us slam shut with a scary bang, like the gates to a fort.</p>
<p>They push me into an operating room toward a big person in a special suit, standing under a group of surgical lights.</p>
<p>He smiles down at me through his face shield and says, as if he knows me, “Welcome back, Jason. Congratulations. You did it.”</p>
<p>Back?</p>
<p>I can only see his eyes, but they don’t remind me of anyone I’ve ever met.</p>
<p>“Are you feeling any pain?” he asks.</p>
<p>I shake my head.</p>
<p>“Do you know how you got the cuts and bruises on your face?”</p>
<p>Shake.</p>
<p>“Do you know who you are?”</p>
<p>I nod.</p>
<p>“Do you know where you are?”</p>
<p>Shake.</p>
<p>“Do you recognize me?”</p>
<p>Shake.</p>
<p>“I’m Leighton Vance, top boss and doctor. We’re colleagues and friends.” He holds up a pair of surgical scissors. “I need to get you out of these clothes.”</p>
<p>He removes the monitoring device and goes to work on my jeans and underwear, tossing them into a metal tray. As he cuts off my shirt, I gaze up at the lights burning down on me, trying not to panic.</p>
<p>But I’m naked and tied to a stretcher.</p>
<p>No, I remind myself, I’m <em>imagining</em> that I’m naked and tied to a stretcher. Because none of this is real.</p>
<p>Leighton lifts the tray holding my shoes and clothes and hands it to someone behind my head, outside my line of sight. “Check everything.”</p>
<p>Footsteps rush out of the room.</p>
<p>I note the sharp sting of rubbing alcohol a second before Leighton cleans a patch of skin on the underside of my arm.</p>
<p>He ties a band above my elbow.</p>
<p>“Just taking some blood,” he says, taking a large needle from the instrument tray.</p>
<p>He’s good. I don’t even feel the sting.</p>
<p>When he’s finished, Leighton rolls the gurney toward the far side of the OR to a glass door with a touchscreen mounted on the wall beside it.</p>
<p>“Wish I could tell you this is the fun part,” he says. “If you’re too confused to remember what’s about to happen, that’s probably for the best.”</p>
<p>I try to ask what’s happening, but words still escape me. Leighton’s fingers dance across the touchscreen. The glass door opens, and he pushes me into a chamber that’s just large enough to hold the gurney.</p>
<p>“Ninety seconds,” he says. “You’ll be fine. It never killed any of the test subjects.”</p>
<p>There’s a hissing sound, and then the glass door slides shut.</p>
<p>Lights in the ceiling glow a cold blue.</p>
<p>I stretch my neck.</p>
<p>The walls on either side of me are covered with detailed openings.</p>
<p>A fine, very cold mist sprays out of the ceiling, covering me head to toe.</p>
<p>My body tightens, the cold drops beading on my skin and freezing solid.</p>
<p>As I shake, the walls of the chamber begin to buzz.</p>
<p>A white fog flows out of the openings with a steady hiss that gets louder and louder.</p>
<p>It flows out fast.</p>
<p>Then shoots out.</p>
<p>Opposing streams hit each other over the gurney, filling the chamber with a thick fog that blocks the overhead light. Where it touches my skin, the frozen drops burst in waves of pain.</p>
<p>The fans turn the other way.</p>
<p>Within five seconds, the gas is pulled out of the chamber, which now has a strange smell, like the air on a summer afternoon just before a thunderstorm—dry lightning and ozone.</p>
<p>The reaction of the gas and the very cold liquid on my skin has created a bubbling foam that burns like a strong acid bath.</p>
<p>I’m grunting, fighting against the straps and wondering how much longer this could be allowed to go on. My limit for pain is high, and this is right at the edge of make-it-stop or kill me.</p>
<p>My thoughts fire very fast.</p>
<p>Is there even a drug able to do this? Making unreal visions and pain at this level of horrible clearness?</p>
<p>This is too much, too real.</p>
<p>What if this is actually happening?</p>
<p>Is this some spy stuff? Am I in a secret clinic going through human tests? Have I been taken by these people?</p>
<p>Glorious, warm water shoots out of the ceiling with the force of a fire hose, hitting the terrible foam away.</p>
<p>When the water shuts off, heated air roars out of the openings, blasting my skin like a hot desert wind.</p>
<p>The pain vanishes.</p>
<p>I’m wide-awake.</p>
<p>The door behind me opens and the gurney rolls back out.</p>
<p>Leighton looks down at me. “Wasn’t so bad, right?” He pushes me through the OR into an adjoining patient room and unlocks the restraints around my ankles and wrists.</p>
<p>With a gloved hand, he pulls me up on the gurney, my head spinning, the room spinning for a moment before the world finally rights itself.</p>
<p>He observes me.</p>
<p>“Better?”</p>
<p>I nod.</p>
<p>There’s a bed and a dresser with a change of clothes folded neatly on top. The walls are padded. There are no sharp edges. As I slide to the edge of the stretcher, Leighton takes hold of my arm above the elbow and helps me to stand.</p>
<p>My legs are rubber, worthless.</p>
<p>He leads me over to the bed.</p>
<p>“I’ll leave you to get dressed and come back when your lab work is in. It won’t take long. Are you all right for me to step out for a minute?”</p>
<p>I finally find my voice: “I don’t understand what’s happening. I don’t know where I—”</p>
<p>“The confusion will pass. I’ll be closely watching. We’ll get you through this.”</p>
<p>He wheels the gurney to the door but stops in the doorway, glancing back at me through his face shield. “It’s really good to see you again, brother. Feels like Mission Control when <em>Apollo Thirteen</em> returned. We’re all real proud of you.”</p>
<p>The door closes after him.</p>
<p>Three deadbolts fire into their housings like a trio of gunshots.</p>
<p>I rise from the bed and walk over to the dresser, unsteady on my feet.</p>
<p>I’m so weak it takes me several minutes to get the clothes on—good pants, a linen shirt, no belt.</p>
<p>From just above the door, a surveillance camera watches me.</p>
<p>I return to the bed, sit alone in this clean, silent room, trying to bring to mind my last clear memory. The mere attempt feels like drowning ten feet from shore. There are pieces of memory lying on the beach, and I can see them, I can almost touch them, but my lungs are filling up with water. I can’t keep my head above the surface. The more I try to put the pieces together, the more energy I use, the more I struggle, the more I panic.</p>
<p>All I have as I sit in this white, padded room is—</p>
<p>Thelonious Monk.</p>
<p>The smell of red wine.</p>
<p>Standing in a kitchen chopping an onion.</p>
<p>A teenager drawing.</p>
<p>Wait.</p>
<p>Not <em>a</em> teenager.</p>
<p><em>My</em> teenager.</p>
<p>My son.</p>
<p>Not <em>a</em> kitchen.</p>
<p><em>My</em> kitchen.</p>
<p>My home.</p>
<p>It was family night. We were cooking together. I can see Daniela’s smile. I can hear her voice and the jazz. Smell the onion, the sour sweetness of wine on Daniela’s breath. See the glassiness in her eyes. What a safe and perfect place, our kitchen on family night.</p>
<p>But I didn’t stay. For some reason, I left. Why?</p>
<p>I’m right there, on the edge of remembering….</p>
<p>The deadbolts pull back, quickly, and the door to the patient room opens. Leighton has traded the special suit for a normal lab coat, and he’s standing in the door frame smiling, as if he’s barely keeping a lid on a lot of excitement. I can now see that he’s roughly my age and like a handsome guy from a private school, his face with a bit of stubble.</p>
<p>“Good news,” he says. “All good.”</p>
<p>“Good of what?”</p>
<p>“Radiation, dangerous germs, sickness. We’ll have full results from your blood test in the morning, but you’re free from being kept separate. Oh. I have this for you.”</p>
<p>He hands me a plastic bag containing a set of keys and a money clip.</p>
<p>“Jason Dessen” has been written in black marker on a piece of tape stuck to the plastic.</p>
<p>“Shall we? They’re all waiting for you.”</p>
<p>I pocket what are apparently my personal things and follow Leighton through the OR.</p>
<p>Back in the hallway, a half-dozen workers are busy pulling the plastic down from the walls.</p>
<p>When they see me, they all begin to clap.</p>
<p>A woman shouts, “You rock, Dessen!”</p>
<p>Glass doors slide open as we approach.</p>
<p>My strength and balance are returning.</p>
<p>He leads me into a stairwell, and we go up, the metal steps banging under our footfalls.</p>
<p>“You okay on these?” Leighton asks.</p>
<p>“Yeah. Where are we going?”</p>
<p>“Talk.”</p>
<p>“But I don’t even—”</p>
<p>“It’s better if you just keep your thoughts for the interview. You know—rules and stuff.”</p>
<p>Two flights up, he opens a glass door that’s an inch thick. We enter another hallway with floor-to-ceiling windows on one side. They look out over a hangar, which the hallways seem to go around—four levels in all—like an open space.</p>
<p>I move toward the windows to get a better look, but Leighton guides me instead through the second door on the left, taking me into a dimly lit room, where a woman in a black pantsuit is standing behind a table as if waiting for my arrival.</p>
<p>“Hi, Jason,” she says.</p>
<p>“Hi.”</p>
<p>Her eyes catch my stare for a moment as Leighton straps the monitoring device around my left arm.</p>
<p>“You don’t mind, do you?” he asks. “I’d feel better keeping track of your health a little while longer. We’ll be safe soon.”</p>
<p>Leighton gently presses his hand into the small of my back and urges me the rest of the way inside.</p>
<p>I hear the door close behind me.</p>
<p>The woman is fortyish. Short, black hair with bangs just skirting striking eyes that somehow manage to be at the same time kind and piercing.</p>
<p>The lighting is soft and not scary, like a movie theater moments before the film begins.</p>
<p>There are two straight-backed wooden chairs, and on the small table a laptop, a pitcher of water, two drinking glasses, a steel carafe, and a steaming mug that fills the room with the smell of good coffee.</p>
<p>The walls and ceiling are made of smoked glass.</p>
<p>“Jason, if you have a seat, we can get started.”</p>
<p>I hesitate for five long seconds, thinking about just walking out, but something tells me that would be a bad, possibly terrible, idea.</p>
<p>So I sit in the chair, reach for the pitcher, and pour myself a glass of water.</p>
<p>The woman says, “If you’re hungry, we can have food brought in.”</p>
<p>“No thanks.”</p>
<p>Finally taking her seat across from me, she pushes her glasses up the bridge of her nose and types something on the laptop.</p>
<p>“It is—” She checks her wristwatch. “—12:07 a.m., October the second. I’m Amanda Lucas, worker ID number nine-five-six-seven, and I’m joined tonight by…” She points to me.</p>
<p>“Um, Jason Dessen.”</p>
<p>“Thank you, Jason. As background, and for the record, at about 10:59 p.m. on October first, Technician Chad Hodge, during a normal inside place check, found Dr. Dessen lying not awake on the floor of the hangar. The rescue team was started, and Dr. Dessen was taken to a safe area at 11:24 p.m. After cleaning and first lab work approval by Dr. Leighton Vance, Dr. Dessen was led to the meeting room on lower level two, where our first talk starts.”</p>
<p>She looks up at me, smiling now.</p>
<p>“Jason, we are happy to have you back. It’s late, but most of the team hurried in from the city for this. As you might have guessed, they’re all watching behind the glass.”</p>
<p>Clapping starts all around us, with cheers and several people shouting my name.</p>
<p>The lights come up just enough for me to see through the walls. Room seats are around the glassed-in talk box. Fifteen or twenty people are standing, most smiling, a few even wiping their eyes as if I’ve come back from some brave job.</p>
<p>I see that two of them are armed, the ends of their guns shining under the lights.</p>
<p>These men aren’t smiling or clapping.</p>
<p>Amanda moves her chair back and, standing, starts to clap with the others.</p>
<p>She seems to be very touched as well.</p>
<p>And all I can think is, What the heck has happened to me?</p>
<p>When the clapping stops, Amanda sits back in her seat.</p>
<p>She says, “Sorry for our excitement, but so far, you’re the only one to return.”</p>
<p>I have no idea what she’s talking about. Part of me wants to say just that, but part of me suspects that maybe I shouldn’t.</p>
<p>The lights dim back down.</p>
<p>I clutch my glass of water in my hands like a lifeline.</p>
<p>“Do you know how long you’ve been gone?” she asks.</p>
<p>Gone where?</p>
<p>“No.”</p>
<p>“Fourteen months.”</p>
<p>Jesus.</p>
<p>“Is that a shock to you, Jason?”</p>
<p>“You could say that.”</p>
<p>“Well, worried and nervous and waiting. We’ve been waiting for over a year to ask these questions: What did you see? Where did you go? How did you get back? Tell us everything, and please start from the beginning.”</p>
<p>I take a sip of water, holding onto my last clear memory like a weak grip on a cliff face—leaving my house on family night.</p>
<p>And then…</p>
<p>I walked down the sidewalk through a cool, fall night. I could hear the sound of the Cubs game in all the bars.</p>
<p>To where?</p>
<p>Where was I going?</p>
<p>“Just take your time, Jason. We’re in no rush.”</p>
<p>Ryan Holder.</p>
<p>That’s who I was going to see.</p>
<p>I walked to Village Tap and had a drink—two drinks, great Scotch, to be exact—with my old college roommate, Ryan Holder.</p>
<p>Is he somehow responsible for this?</p>
<p>I wonder again: Is this actually happening?</p>
<p>I raise the glass of water. It looks perfectly real, right down to the way it sweats and the cold wetness of it on my fingertips.</p>
<p>I look into Amanda’s eyes.</p>
<p>I look at the walls.</p>
<p>They’re not melting.</p>
<p>If this is some drug-caused trip, it’s like none I’ve ever heard of. No visual or hearing problems. No great joy. It’s not that this place doesn’t feel real. I just shouldn’t be here. It’s somehow <em>my</em> being here that’s the lie. I’m not even exactly sure what that means, only that I feel it in my core.</p>
<p>No, this is not a dream. This is something else entirely.</p>
<p>“Let’s try a different way,” Amanda says. “What’s the last thing you remember before waking up in the hangar?”</p>
<p>“I was at a bar.”</p>
<p>“What were you doing there?”</p>
<p>“Seeing an old friend.”</p>
<p>“And where was this bar?” she asks.</p>
<p>“Logan Square.”</p>
<p>“So you were still in Chicago.”</p>
<p>“Yeah.”</p>
<p>“Okay, can you describe…?”</p>
<p>Her voice drops off into silence.</p>
<p>I see the El.</p>
<p>It’s dark.</p>
<p>It’s quiet.</p>
<p>Too quiet for Chicago.</p>
<p>Someone is coming.</p>
<p>Someone who wants to harm me.</p>
<p>My heart begins to race.</p>
<p>My hands sweat.</p>
<p>I set the glass down on the table.</p>
<p>“Jason, Leighton is telling me your health signs are getting higher.”</p>
<p>Her voice is back but still an ocean away.</p>
<p>Is this a trick?</p>
<p>Am I being messed with?</p>
<p>No, do not ask her that. Do not say those words. Be the man they think you are. These people are cool, calm, and <em>two of them are armed</em>. Whatever they need to hear you say, say it. Because if they realize you aren’t the person they think you are, then what?</p>
<p>Then maybe you never leave this place.</p>
<p>My head is starting to hurt. Reaching up, I touch the back of my head and feel a bump that’s so sore it causes me to wince.</p>
<p>“Jason?”</p>
<p>Was I hurt?</p>
<p>Did someone attack me? What if I was brought here? What if these people, despite how nice they seem, are working with the person who did this to me?</p>
<p>I touch the side of my head, feel the hurt from a second blow.</p>
<p>“Jason.”</p>
<p>I see a geisha mask.</p>
<p>I’m naked and helpless.</p>
<p>“Jason.”</p>
<p>Just a few hours ago I was home, cooking dinner.</p>
<p>I am not the man they think I am. What happens when they figure that out?</p>
<p>“Leighton, could you come down, please?”</p>
<p>Nothing good.</p>
<p>I need to not be in this room anymore.</p>
<p>I need to get away from these people.</p>
<p>I need to think.</p>
<p>“Amanda.” I pull myself back into the moment, try to push the questions and the fear out of my mind, but it’s like fixing a broken wall. It won’t last. It won’t hold. “This is embarrassing,” I say. “I’m just so tired, and to be honest, cleaning was no fun.”</p>
<p>“Do you want to stop for a minute?”</p>
<p>“Would that be okay? I just need a moment to clear my head.” I point at the laptop. “I also want to sound kind of smart for this thing.”</p>
<p>“Of course.” She types something. “We’re off the record now.”</p>
<p>I get up.</p>
<p>She says, “I can show you to a private room—”</p>
<p>“Not necessary.”</p>
<p>I open the door and step out into the hallway.</p>
<p>Leighton Vance is waiting.</p>
<p>“Jason, I’d like you to lie down. Your health signs are headed in the wrong direction.”</p>
<p>I rip the device off my arm and hand it to the doctor.</p>
<p>“Appreciate the worry, but what I really need is a bathroom stall.”</p>
<p>“Oh. Of course. I’ll take you.”</p>
<p>We head down the hallway.</p>
<p>Pushing his shoulder into the heavy glass door, he leads me back into the stairwell, which at the moment is empty. No sound but the ventilation system pumping heated air through a nearby vent. I grab the railing and lean out over the core of open space.</p>
<p>Two flights to the bottom, two to the top.</p>
<p>What did Amanda say at the start of the interview? That we’re on sublevel two? Does that mean this is all underground?</p>
<p>“Jason? You coming?”</p>
<p>I follow Leighton, climbing, fighting through the weakness in my legs, the hurt in my head.</p>
<p>At the top of the stairwell, a sign beside a strong-steel door reads GROUND. Leighton swipes a keycard, punches in a code, and holds the door open.</p>
<p>The words VELOCITY LABORATORIES are stuck in block letters across the wall straight ahead.</p>
<p>Left: a bank of elevators.</p>
<p>Right: a security checkpoint, with a hard-looking guard standing between the metal detector and the turnstile, the exit just beyond.</p>
<p>It seems like the security here is outward facing, focused more on stopping people from getting in than getting out.</p>
<p>Leighton directs me past the elevators and down a hallway to a pair of double doors at the far end, which he opens with his keycard.</p>
<p>As we enter, he hits the lights, showing a nice office, the walls covered in airplane pictures of commercial airliners and military fast jets and the engines that power them.</p>
<p>A framed photo on the desk draws my focus—an older man holding a boy in his arms that looks very much like Leighton. They’re standing in a hangar in front of a big turbofan being put together.</p>
<p>“I thought you’d be more comfortable in my private bathroom.” Leighton points toward a door in the far corner. “I’ll be right here,” he says, sitting down on the edge of his desk and pulling a phone out of his pocket. “Shout if you need anything.”</p>
<p>The bathroom is cold and spotless.</p>
<p>There’s a toilet, a urinal, a walk-in shower, and a small window halfway up the back wall.</p>
<p>I take a seat on the toilet.</p>
<p>My chest feels so tight I can barely breathe.</p>
<p>They’ve been waiting for me to return for fourteen months. There’s no way they’re letting me walk out of this building. Not tonight. Maybe not for a long time considering I’m not the man they think they’re talking to.</p>
<p>Unless this is all some detailed test or game.</p>
<p>Leighton’s voice pushes through the door: “Everything all right in there?”</p>
<p>“Yeah.”</p>
<p>“I don’t know what you saw inside that thing, but I want you to know I’m here for you, brother. If you’re freaking out, you got to tell me, so I can help you.”</p>
<p>I rise.</p>
<p>He continues, “I was watching you from the theater, and I have to say, you looked out of it.”</p>
<p>If I were to walk back into the lobby with him, could I break away, make a run through security? I picture that massive guard standing by the metal detector. Probably not.</p>
<p>“Physically, I think you’re going to be fine, but I worry about your mental state.”</p>
<p>I have to step onto the lip of the porcelain urinal to reach the window. The glass appears to be locked shut by means of a lever on each side.</p>
<p>It’s only two feet by two feet, and I’m not sure if I can fit through.</p>
<p>Leighton’s voice echoes through the bathroom, and as I creep back toward the sink, his words become clear again.</p>
<p>“…worst thing you can do is try to handle this on your own. Let’s be honest. You’re the kind of guy who thinks he’s strong enough to push through anything.”</p>
<p>I approach the door.</p>
<p>There’s a deadbolt.</p>
<p>With shaking fingers, I slowly turn the lock cylinder.</p>
<p>“But no matter what you’re feeling,” his voice close now, inches away, “I want you to share it with me, and if we need to push this talk until tomorrow or the next—”</p>
<p>He goes silent as the bolt shoots home with a soft <em>click</em>.</p>
<p>For a moment, nothing happens.</p>
<p>I take a careful step back.</p>
<p>The door moves slightly, and then shakes wildly inside its frame.</p>
<p>Leighton says, “Jason. Jason!” And then: “I need a security team to my office right now. Dessen has locked himself inside the bathroom.”</p>
<p>The door shudders as Leighton crashes into it, but the lock holds.</p>
<p>I rush for the window, climb up onto the urinal, and flip the levers on either side of the glass.</p>
<p>Leighton is shouting at someone, and although I can’t make out the words, I think I hear approaching footsteps.</p>
<p>The window opens.</p>
<p>Night air flows in.</p>
<p>Even standing on the urinal, I’m not sure if I can make it up there.</p>
<p>Leaping off the edge, I throw myself toward the open frame, but only manage to get one arm through.</p>
<p>As something bangs into the bathroom door, my shoes scrape across the smooth, vertical surface of the wall. There’s no grip or hold to be had.</p>
<p>I drop to the floor, climb back up onto the urinal.</p>
<p>Leighton screams at someone, “Come on!”</p>
<p>I jump again, and this time, I manage to land both arms across the windowsill. It isn’t much of a hold, but it’s just enough to keep me from falling.</p>
<p>I wiggle through as the bathroom door breaks down behind me.</p>
<p>Leighton yells my name.</p>
<p>I tumble for a half second through darkness.</p>
<p>Crash face-first into pavement.</p>
<p>Up on my feet, surprised, confused, ears ringing, blood running down the side of my face.</p>
<p>I’m outside, in a dark alley between two buildings.</p>
<p>Leighton appears in the open window frame above me.</p>
<p>“Jason, don’t do this. Let me help you.”</p>
<p>I turn and run, no idea where I’m going, just blazing toward the opening at the end of the alley.</p>
<p>I reach it.</p>
<p>Launch down a set of brick steps.</p>
<p>I’m in an office park.</p>
<p>Bland, low-rise buildings cluster around a sad little pond with a lighted fountain in the middle.</p>
<p>Considering the hour, it’s no surprise there’s no one out.</p>
<p>I fly past benches, trimmed bushes, a gazebo, a sign with an arrow under the words TO WALKING PATH.</p>
<p>A quick glance over my shoulder: the building I just escaped is a five-story, plain, utterly forgettable piece of architectural mediocrity, and people are streaming out of the entrance like a kicked hornet’s nest.</p>
<p>At the end of the pond, I leave the sidewalk and follow a gravel footpath.</p>
<p>Sweat stings my eyes, my lungs are on fire, but I keep pumping my arms and throwing one foot in front of the other.</p>
<p>With each stride, the lights from the office park fall farther and farther away.</p>
<p>Straight ahead, there’s nothing but welcoming darkness, and I’m moving toward it, into it, like my life depends upon it.</p>
<p>A strong, reviving wind slams into my face, and I’m starting to wonder where I’m going because shouldn’t there be some light in the distance? Like even a speck of it? But I’m running into an immense chasm of black.</p>
<p>I hear waves.</p>
<p>I arrive on a beach.</p>
<p>There’s no moon, but the stars are vivid enough to suggest the moving surface of Lake Michigan.</p>
<p>I look inland toward the office park, catch incoming, wind-cut voices, and glimpse several flashlight beams slashing through the dark.</p>
<p>Turning north, I begin to run, my shoes crunching wave-polished rocks. Miles up the shoreline, I can see the unclear, nighttime glow of downtown, where the skyscrapers edge up against the water.</p>
<p>I look back, see some lights heading south, away from me, others heading north.</p>
<p>Gaining on me.</p>
<p>I veer away from the water’s edge, cross a bike path, and aim for a row of bushes.</p>
<p>The voices are closer.</p>
<p>I wonder if it’s dark enough for me to stay unseen.</p>
<p>A three-foot seawall stands in my path, and I climb the concrete, hitting my shins on the way over and staying on all fours as I crawl through the hedgerow, branches grabbing my shirt and face, scratching at my eyes.</p>
<p>Out of the bushes, I stumble into the middle of a road that parallels the lakeshore.</p>
<p>From the direction of the office park, I hear an engine speeding up.</p>
<p>Bright lights blind me.</p>
<p>I cross the road, hop a chain-link fence, and suddenly I’m running through someone’s yard, dodging overturned bicycles and skateboards, then darting alongside the house while a dog goes crazy inside, lights popping on as I hit the backyard, jump the fence again, and find myself sprinting across an empty baseball outfield, wondering how much longer I can keep this up.</p>
<p>The answer comes with remarkable speed.</p>
<p>On the edge of the infield, I collapse, sweat pouring off my body, every muscle in pain.</p>
<p>That dog is still barking in the distance, but looking back toward the lake, I see no flashlights, hear no voices.</p>
<p>I lie there I don’t know how long, and it seems as if hours pass before I can take a breath without gasping.</p>
<p>I finally manage to sit up.</p>
<p>The night is cool, and the breeze coming off the lake pushes through the nearby trees, sending a shower of autumn leaves down on the field.</p>
<p>I struggle to my feet, thirsty and tired and trying to understand the last four hours of my life, but I don’t have the mental space at the moment.</p>
<p>I walk out of the baseball field, into a working-class South Side neighborhood.</p>
<p>The streets are empty.</p>
<p>It’s block after block of calm, quiet homes.</p>
<p>I walk a mile, maybe more, and then I’m standing at the empty crossing of a business area, watching the traffic lights above me change at a fast, late-night speed.</p>
<p>The main street runs two blocks, and there’s no sign of life except the dirty bar across the street with three cheap beer signs glowing in the windows. As people stumble out in a cloud of smoke and loud talks, headlights from the first car I’ve seen in twenty minutes appear in the distance.</p>
<p>A cab with the Off-Duty light lit.</p>
<p>I step out into the crossing and stand under the traffic light, waving my arms. The taxi slows down as it comes closer and tries to go around me, but I step aside, keeping its bumper on a crash path, forcing it to stop.</p>
<p>The driver lowers his window, angry.</p>
<p>“What the heck are you doing?”</p>
<p>“I need a ride.”</p>
<p>The cabbie is Somali, his very thin face marked with spots of a beard, and he’s staring at me through a pair of big, thick glasses.</p>
<p>He says, “It’s two in the morning. I’m finished tonight. No more work.”</p>
<p>“Please.”</p>
<p>“Can you read? Look at the sign.” He hits the top of his car.</p>
<p>“I need to get home.”</p>
<p>The window begins to go up.</p>
<p>I reach into my pocket and pull out the plastic bag holding my things, tear it open, show him the money clip.</p>
<p>“I can pay you more than—”</p>
<p>“Get out of the road.”</p>
<p>“I’ll double your price.”</p>
<p>The window stops six inches from the top of the door.</p>
<p>“Cash.”</p>
<p>“Cash.”</p>
<p>I flip quickly through the stack of bills. It’s probably a $75 ride to the North Side neighborhoods, and I’ve got to cover double that.</p>
<p>“Get in if we go!” he yells.</p>
<p>Some of the bar customers have noticed the cab stopped in the intersection, and probably needing rides, they are moving over, shouting for me to hold the car.</p>
<p>I finish counting my funds—$332 and three old credit cards.</p>
<p>I climb into the backseat and tell him I’m going to Logan Square.</p>
<p>“That’s twenty-five miles!”</p>
<p>“And I’m paying you double.”</p>
<p>He stares at me in the rearview mirror.</p>
<p>“Where’s the money?”</p>
<p>I pull off $100 and hand it into the front seat. “The rest when we get there.”</p>
<p>He grabs the money and speeds through the intersection, past the drunks.</p>
<p>I examine the money clip. Under the cash and the credit cards, there’s an Illinois driver’s license with a headshot that’s me but that I’ve never seen, an ID for a gym I’ve never been to, and a health insurance card from a company I’ve never used.</p>
<p>The cabbie sneaks looks at me in the rearview mirror.</p>
<p>“You have bad night,” he says.</p>
<p>“Looks that way, huh?”</p>
<p>“I thought you are drunk, but no. Your clothes are ripped. Face bloody.”</p>
<p>I probably wouldn’t have wanted to pick me up either, standing in the middle of a street at two in the morning, looking homeless and crazy.</p>
<p>“You’re in trouble,” he says.</p>
<p>“Yeah.”</p>
<p>“What happened?”</p>
<p>“I’m not exactly sure.”</p>
<p>“I take you to hospital.”</p>
<p>“No. I want to go home.”</p>
<h2><span id="chapter-3">Chapter 3</span></h2>
<p>We drive north toward the city on the empty highway, the skyline getting closer and closer. With each passing mile, I feel some sense of my sanity returning, if for no other reason than I’ll be home soon.</p>
<p>Daniela will help me understand whatever’s happening.</p>
<p>The cabbie parks across from my brownstone and I pay him the rest of his fare.</p>
<p>I hurry across the street and up the steps, pulling keys out of my pocket that aren’t my keys. As I try to find the one that fits the lock, I realize this isn’t my door. Well, it is my door. It’s my street. My number on the mailbox. But the handle isn’t right, the wood is too fancy, and the hinges are these iron, old-looking things more suited to a medieval tavern.</p>
<p>I turn the deadbolt.</p>
<p>The door swings inward.</p>
<p>Something is wrong.</p>
<p>Very, very wrong.</p>
<p>I step across the doorway, into the dining room.</p>
<p>This doesn’t smell like my house. Doesn’t smell like anything but the faintest smell of dust. Like no one has lived here in quite some time. The lights are out, and not just some of them. Every last one.</p>
<p>I close the door and fumble in the darkness until my hand touches a dimmer switch. A chandelier made of antlers brightens the room above a simple glass table that isn’t mine and chairs that aren’t mine.</p>
<p>I call out, “Hello?”</p>
<p>The house is so quiet.</p>
<p>Terribly quiet.</p>
<p>In <em>my</em> home on the mantel behind the dining-room table there’s a large, clear photograph of Daniela, Charlie, and me standing at Inspiration Point in Yellowstone National Park.</p>
<p>In <em>this</em> house, there’s a strong black-and-white photograph of the same canyon. More skillfully done, but with no one in it.</p>
<p>I move on to the kitchen, and at my entrance, a sensor starts the hidden lights.</p>
<p>It’s beautiful.</p>
<p>Pricey.</p>
<p>And empty.</p>
<p>In <em>my</em> house, there’s a Charlie first-grade creation (macaroni art) held by magnets to our white refrigerator. It makes me smile every time I see it. In <em>this</em> kitchen, there’s not even a mark on the steel front of the Gaggenau refrigerator.</p>
<p>“Daniela!”</p>
<p>Even the sound of my voice is different here.</p>
<p>“Charlie!”</p>
<p>There’s less stuff, more echo.</p>
<p>As I walk through the living room, I see my old record player sitting next to a modern sound system, my jazz records carefully stored and in order on special, built-in shelves.</p>
<p>I head up the stairs to the second floor.</p>
<p>The hallway is dark and the light switch isn’t where it should be, but it doesn’t matter. Much of the lights work by movement, and more lights turn on above me.</p>
<p>This isn’t my wood floor. It’s better, the boards wider, a little rougher.</p>
<p>Between the hall bathroom and the guest room, the three pictures of my family at the Wisconsin Dells has been replaced with a drawing of Navy Pier. Charcoal on paper. The artist’s name at the bottom right catches my eye—Daniela Vargas.</p>
<p>I step into the next room on the left.</p>
<p>My son’s room.</p>
<p>Except it’s not. There’s none of his strange art. No bed, no comic book posters, no desk with homework all over it, no lava lamps, no backpack, no clothes on the floor.</p>
<p>Instead, just a screen sitting on a big desk that’s covered in books and loose paper.</p>
<p>I walk in shock to the end of the hallway. Sliding a frosted door into the wall, I enter a master bedroom that is fancy, cold, and, like everything else in this house, not mine.</p>
<p>The walls have more drawings in the same style as the one in the hall, but the main thing in the room is a glass case built into a wood stand. Light from the bottom shines up to show a certificate in a soft leather folder that leans against a soft velvet stand. Hanging from a chain on the stand is a gold coin with Julian Pavia’s face on it.</p>
<p>The certificate reads:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Pavia Prize is given to</p>
<p>JASON ASHLEY DESSEN for great work in moving forward our knowledge and understanding of the start, change and features of the universe by placing a large object into a state of </p>
<p>quantum superposition.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I sit on the end of the bed.</p>
<p>I am not well.</p>
<p>I am so not well.</p>
<p>My home should be my safe place, a place of safety and comfort, where I’m surrounded by family. But it’s not even mine.</p>
<p>My stomach jumps.</p>
<p>I rush into the master bath, fling open the toilet seat, and empty my guts into the clean bowl.</p>
<p>I’m very thirsty.</p>
<p>I turn on the faucet and dip my mouth under the stream.</p>
<p>Splash water in my face.</p>
<p>I wander back into the bedroom.</p>
<p>No idea where my mobile phone is, but there’s a landline on the bedside table.</p>
<p>I never actually dial Daniela’s cell-phone number, so it takes me a moment to remember, but I finally type it in.</p>
<p>Four rings.</p>
<p>A male voice answers, low and sleepy.</p>
<p>“Hello?”</p>
<p>“Where’s Daniela?”</p>
<p>“I think you called the wrong number.”</p>
<p>I say Daniela’s cell phone number, and he says, “Yeah, that’s the number you called, but it’s my number.”</p>
<p>“How is that possible?”</p>
<p>He hangs up.</p>
<p>I dial her number again, and this time he answers on the first ring with, “It’s three in the morning. Don’t call me again, jerk.”</p>
<p>My third try goes straight to the man’s voicemail. I don’t leave a message.</p>
<p>Rising from the bed, I return to the bathroom and look at myself in the mirror over the sink.</p>
<p>My face is hurt, scratched, bloody, and muddy. I need a shave, my eyes are red, but I’m still me.</p>
<p>A wave of tiredness hits me like a hard punch to the jaw.</p>
<p>My knees give way, but I catch myself on the countertop.</p>
<p>And then, down on the first floor—a noise.</p>
<p>A door closing quietly?</p>
<p>I stand up straight.</p>
<p>Awake again.</p>
<p>Back in the bedroom, I move quietly to the doorway and stare down the length of the hall.</p>
<p>I hear quiet voices.</p>
<p>The static of a small radio.</p>
<p>The hollow <em>creak</em> of someone’s foot on a wood step.</p>
<p>The voices become clearer, echoing between the walls of the stairs and spilling out the top and down the hall.</p>
<p>I can see their shadows on the walls now, going before them up the staircase like ghosts.</p>
<p>As I take a careful step into the hallway, a man’s voice—calm, even Leighton—slides out of the stairwell: “Jason?”</p>
<p>Five steps and I reach the hall bath.</p>
<p>“We’re not here to harm you.”</p>
<p>Their footsteps are in the hallway now.</p>
<p>Stepping slowly, carefully.</p>
<p>“I know you’re feeling confused and lost. I wish you’d said something back at the lab. I didn’t realize how bad it was for you. I’m sorry I missed that.”</p>
<p>I carefully close the door behind me and push in the lock.</p>
<p>“We just want to bring you in so you don’t hurt yourself or anyone else.”</p>
<p>The bathroom is twice the size of mine, with a stone-walled shower and a double sink topped with marble.</p>
<p>Across from the toilet, I see what I’m looking for: a large shelf built into the wall with a door that opens the laundry chute.</p>
<p>“Jason.”</p>
<p>Through the bathroom door, I hear the radio crackling.</p>
<p>“Jason, please. Talk to me.” Out of nowhere, his voice bursts with frustration. “We have all given up our lives working toward tonight. Come out here! This is freaking crazy!”</p>
<p>One rainy Sunday when Charlie was nine or ten, we spent an afternoon pretending we were cave explorers. I would lower him down the laundry chute again and again, as if it were the entrance to a cave. He even wore a little backpack and a fake headlamp—a flashlight tied to the top of his head.</p>
<p>I open the hatch, climb up onto the shelf.</p>
<p>Leighton says, “Take the bedroom.”</p>
<p>Footsteps patter down the hall.</p>
<p>The fit down the laundry chute looks tight. Maybe too tight.</p>
<p>I hear the bathroom door begin to shake, the doorknob jiggling, and then a woman’s voice: “Hey, this one’s locked.”</p>
<p>I peer down the chute.</p>
<p>Total darkness.</p>
<p>The bathroom door is thick enough that their first attempt to break through only results in a splintering crack.</p>
<p>I might not even fit down this thing, but as they crash into the door a second time and it explodes off the hinges and thunders down against the tile, I realize I have no other options.</p>
<p>They rush into the bathroom, and in the mirror I catch the quick reflection of Leighton Vance and one of those security consultants from the lab, holding what appears to be a Taser.</p>
<p>Leighton and I look at each other in the glass for a half second, and then the man with the Taser turns, raising his weapon.</p>
<p>I fold my arms into my chest and go into the chute.</p>
<p>As the shouting in the bathroom fades away above me, I slam into an empty laundry basket, the plastic breaking, sending me tumbling out from between the washer and the dryer.</p>
<p>Their footsteps are already coming, pounding down the staircase.</p>
<p>A needle of pain goes up my right leg from the fall. I scramble to my feet and run for the French doors that lead out the back of the brownstone.</p>
<p>The brass door handles are locked.</p>
<p>Footsteps are closing in, the voices louder, radios squeaking as instructions scream over static.</p>
<p>I turn the lock, pull open the doors, and tear across a redwood deck, which has a grill that’s nicer than mine and a hot tub I have never owned.</p>
<p>Down the steps into the backyard, past a rose garden.</p>
<p>I try the garage door, but it’s locked.</p>
<p>With all the movement inside, every light in the house has been turned on. There must be four or five people running around on the first floor trying to find me, shouting at one another.</p>
<p>An eight-foot privacy fence encloses the backyard, and as I flip the latch on its door, someone runs onto the deck, shouting my name.</p>
<p>The alley is empty, and I don’t stop to think which way to go.</p>
<p>I just run.</p>
<p>At the next street, I look back, see two figures chasing me.</p>
<p>In the distance, a car engine starts, followed by the screech of tires spinning on pavement.</p>
<p>I turn left and sprint until I reach the next alley.</p>
<p>Almost every backyard is protected by tall privacy fencing, but the fifth one down is waist-high, wrought-iron construction.</p>
<p>An SUV turns its back end around and speeds into the alley.</p>
<p>I break for the low fence.</p>
<p>Lacking the strength to jump it, I clumsily pull myself over the pointed metal tines and collapse in the backyard. I crawl through the grass to a tiny shed beside the garage, with no lock on the door.</p>
<p>It creaks open, and I slip inside as someone runs across the backyard.</p>
<p>I shut the door so no one will hear my panting.</p>
<p>I cannot catch my breath.</p>
<p>It’s completely dark inside the shed and smells of gasoline and old grass clippings. My chest heaves against the back of the door.</p>
<p>Sweat drips off my chin.</p>
<p>I claw a spiderweb off my face.</p>
<p>In darkness, my hands touch the plywood walls, fingers touching different tools—pruning shears, a saw, a rake, the blade of an ax.</p>
<p>I take the ax from the wall and grip the wooden handle, scraping my finger across the head. Can’t see a thing, but it feels like it hasn’t been sharpened in years—deep dents in the blade, which no longer holds an edge.</p>
<p>Blinking through the stinging sweat, I carefully open the door.</p>
<p>Not a sound creeps in.</p>
<p>I nudge it open a few more inches, until I can see into the backyard again.</p>
<p>It’s empty.</p>
<p>In this sliver of quiet and calm, the idea of the simplest answer whispers to me—all things being equal, the simplest solution tends to be the right one. Does the idea that I was drugged and kidnapped by a secret, testing group for the purposes of mind control or God-knows-what fit that bill? Hardly. They would’ve needed to either brainwash me to convince me that my house was not my house, or in the space of several hours, get rid of my family and gut the inside so I didn’t recognize anything.</p>
<p>Or—is it more likely that a growth in my brain has turned my world upside down?</p>
<p>That it’s been growing silently inside my skull for months or years and is finally messing up my thinking, changing my view of everything.</p>
<p>The idea hits me with the force of belief.</p>
<p>What else could have crashed through me with such terrible speed?</p>
<p>What else could make me lose touch with my identity and reality in a matter of hours, making me wonder about everything I thought I knew?</p>
<p>I wait.</p>
<p>And wait.</p>
<p>And wait.</p>
<p>Finally, I step outside into the grass.</p>
<p>No more voices.</p>
<p>No more footsteps.</p>
<p>No shadows.</p>
<p>No car engines.</p>
<p>The night feels strong and real again.</p>
<p>I already know where I’m going next.</p>
<p>Chicago Mercy is a ten-block walk from my house, and I limp into the bright light of the ER at 4:05 a.m.</p>
<p>I hate hospitals.</p>
<p>I watched my mother die in one.</p>
<p>Charlie spent the first weeks of his life in a NICU.</p>
<p>The waiting room is almost empty. Aside from me, there’s a night construction worker holding his arm in a bloody bandage, and a worried-looking family of three, the father holding a red-faced, crying baby.</p>
<p>The woman at the front desk looks up from her paperwork, surprisingly awake considering the hour.</p>
<p>Asks through the Plexiglas, “How can I help you?”</p>
<p>I haven’t thought of what to say, how to even begin to explain my needs.</p>
<p>When I don’t answer right away, she says, “Have you been in an accident?”</p>
<p>“No.”</p>
<p>“You have cuts all over your face.”</p>
<p>“I’m not well,” I say.</p>
<p>“What do you mean?”</p>
<p>“I think I need to talk to someone.”</p>
<p>“Are you homeless?”</p>
<p>“No.”</p>
<p>“Where’s your family?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know.”</p>
<p>She looks me up and down—a fast, work-like check.</p>
<p>“Your name, sir?”</p>
<p>“Jason.”</p>
<p>“One moment.”</p>
<p>Rising from her chair, she disappears around the corner.</p>
<p>Thirty seconds later, there’s a buzzing sound as the door beside her station unlocks and opens.</p>
<p>The nurse smiles. “Come on back.”</p>
<p>She leads me to a patient room.</p>
<p>“Someone will be right with you.”</p>
<p>As the door closes after her, I take a seat on the examination table and shut my eyes against the bright lights. I have never been so tired in my life.</p>
<p>My chin dips.</p>
<p>I straighten.</p>
<p>I almost fell asleep sitting up.</p>
<p>The door opens.</p>
<p>A stout young doctor walks in carrying a clipboard. He’s followed by a different nurse—a blonde in blue clothes who wears four-in-the-morning tiredness like a weight around her neck.</p>
<p>“It’s Jason?” the doctor asks without offering his hand or trying to fake his way through the late-night disinterest.</p>
<p>I nod.</p>
<p>“Last name?”</p>
<p>I’m slow to give him my full name, but then again, maybe that’s just the brain tumor talking, or whatever has gone wrong inside my head.</p>
<p>“Dessen.”</p>
<p>I say it for him as he writes on what I guess to be an entry form.</p>
<p>“I’m Dr. Randolph, main doctor. What brings you into the ER tonight?”</p>
<p>“I think something is wrong with my mind. Like a growth or something.”</p>
<p>“What makes you say that?”</p>
<p>“Things aren’t like they should be.”</p>
<p>“Okay. Could you explain more?”</p>
<p>“I…all right, this is going to sound crazy. Just know that I realize that.”</p>
<p>He looks up from the clipboard.</p>
<p>“My house isn’t my house.”</p>
<p>“I’m not understanding.”</p>
<p>“It’s just what I said. My house isn’t my house. My family isn’t there. Everything’s much…nicer. It’s all been fixed up and—”</p>
<p>“But it’s still your address?”</p>
<p>“Right.”</p>
<p>“So you’re saying the inside is different, but the outside is the same?” He says it like he’s speaking to a child.</p>
<p>“Yeah.”</p>
<p>“Jason, how did you get the cuts on your face? The dirt on your clothes?”</p>
<p>“People were running after me.”</p>
<p>I shouldn’t have told him that, but I’m too tired to think. I must sound absolutely crazy.</p>
<p>“Running after you.”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>“Who was running after you?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know.”</p>
<p>“Do you know <em>why</em> they were running after you?”</p>
<p>“Because…it’s hard to explain.”</p>
<p>His careful, doubtful look is much quieter and practiced than the front-desk nurse’s. I almost miss it.</p>
<p>“Have you taken any drugs or alcohol tonight?” he asks.</p>
<p>“Some wine earlier, then whisky, but that was hours ago.”</p>
<p>“Again, I’m sorry—it’s been a very long shift—but what makes you think something is wrong with your mind?”</p>
<p>“Because the last eight hours of my life don’t make sense. It all feels real, but it can’t possibly be.”</p>
<p>“Have you suffered a recent head injury?”</p>
<p>“No. Well. I mean, I think someone hit me in the back of the head. It’s painful to the touch.”</p>
<p>“Who hit you?”</p>
<p>“I’m not sure. I’m not really sure of anything right now.”</p>
<p>“Okay. Do you use drugs? Now or in the past?”</p>
<p>“I smoke weed a couple times a year. But not lately.”</p>
<p>The doctor turns to the nurse. “I’m going to have Barbara take some blood.”</p>
<p>He drops the clipboard on a table and takes a small flashlight from the front pocket of his lab coat.</p>
<p>“Mind if I check you?”</p>
<p>“No.”</p>
<p>Randolph moves in until our faces are inches apart, close enough for me to smell the old coffee on his breath, to see the recent razor cut across his chin. He shines the light straight into my right eye. For a moment, there’s nothing but a point of brightness in the center of my view, which briefly burns away the rest of the world.</p>
<p>“Jason, are you having any thoughts of hurting yourself?”</p>
<p>“I’m not suicidal.”</p>
<p>The light hits my left eye.</p>
<p>“Have you had any past mental hospital stays?”</p>
<p>“No.”</p>
<p>He gently takes my wrist in his soft, cool hands, measures my pulse rate.</p>
<p>“What do you do for a job?” he asks.</p>
<p>“I teach at Lakemont College.”</p>
<p>“Married?”</p>
<p>“Yes.” I automatically reach down to touch my wedding ring.</p>
<p>Gone.</p>
<p>Jesus.</p>
<p>The nurse starts to roll up the left sleeve of my shirt.</p>
<p>“What’s your wife’s name?” the doctor asks.</p>
<p>“Daniela.”</p>
<p>“Are you two doing okay?”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>“Don’t you think she’s wondering where you are? I feel like we should call her.”</p>
<p>“I tried.”</p>
<p>“When?”</p>
<p>“An hour ago, at my house. Someone else answered. It was a wrong number.”</p>
<p>“Maybe you dialed wrong.”</p>
<p>“I know my wife’s phone number.”</p>
<p>The nurse asks, “We okay with needles, Mr. Dessen?”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>As she cleans the bottom of my arm, she says, “Dr. Randolph, look.” She touches the needle mark from several hours ago when Leighton took my blood.</p>
<p>“When did this happen?” he asks.</p>
<p>“I don’t know.” Probably best not to mention the lab I think I just got away from.</p>
<p>“You don’t remember someone putting a needle in your arm?”</p>
<p>“No.”</p>
<p>Randolph nods to the nurse, and she warns me, “Small pinch coming.”</p>
<p>He asks, “Do you have your cell phone with you?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know where it is.”</p>
<p>He grabs the clipboard. “Give me your wife’s name again. And phone number. We’ll try to call her for you.”</p>
<p>I spell Daniela’s name and say her cell number and our home number as my blood rushes into a plastic vial.</p>
<p>“You’re going to scan my head?” I ask. “See what’s going on?”</p>
<p>“Absolutely.”</p>
<p>—</p>
<p>They give me a private room on the eighth floor.</p>
<p>I clean up my face in the bathroom, take off my shoes, and climb into bed.</p>
<p>Sleep pulls, but the thinker in my brain won’t shut down.</p>
<p>I can’t stop thinking.</p>
<p>Making ideas and breaking them down.</p>
<p>Trying to make sense of everything that’s happened.</p>
<p>In this moment, I have no way of knowing what’s real and what isn’t. I can’t even be sure that I was ever married.</p>
<p>No. Wait.</p>
<p>I raise my left hand and study my ring finger.</p>
<p>The ring is gone, but the proof of its existence stays as a faint dent around the base of my finger. It was there. It left a mark. That means someone took it.</p>
<p>I touch the dent, knowing both the fear and the ease of what it shows—the last bit of <em>my</em> reality.</p>
<p>I wonder—</p>
<p>What will happen when this last real trace of my marriage is gone?</p>
<p>When there’s no hold?</p>
<p>As the skies above Chicago move toward dawn—a sad, cloud-covered purple—I lose myself to sleep.</p>
