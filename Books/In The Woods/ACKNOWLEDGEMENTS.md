## ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

I owe huge debts of thanks to a lot of people: Ciara Considine, my editor at Hodder Headline Ireland, whose unerring instincts, unfailing kindness and enthusiasm have helped this book forward, from start to finish, in too many ways to count; Darley Anderson, super-agent and dream-maker, who has left me speechless more times than anyone I know; his amazing team, especially Emma White, Lucie Whitehouse and Zoë King; Sue Fletcher of Hodder & Stoughton and Kendra Harpster of Viking, editors _extraordinaires_ , for their breathtaking faith in this book and for knowing exactly how to make it better; Swati Gamble for her phenomenal patience; all at Hodder & Stoughton and Hodder Headline Ireland; Helena Burling, whose kindness gave me the haven in which to write this; Oonagh ‘Bulrushes’ Montague, Ann-Marie Hardiman, Mary Kelly and Fidelma Keogh, for holding my hand when I needed it most and keeping me more or less sane; my brother, Alex French, for fixing my computer on a regular basis; David Ryan, for waiving non-intellectual property rights; Alice Wood, for her eagle-eyed copy-editing; Dr Fearghas Ó Cochláin, for the medical bits; Ron and the Anonymous Angel, who by some grey magic always knew the precise moment; Cheryl Steckel, Steven Foster and Deirdre Nolan, for reading and encouraging; all of PurpleHeart Theatre Company, for their ongoing support; and, last but so very far from least, Anthony Breatnach, whose patience, support, help and faith have been beyond words.
