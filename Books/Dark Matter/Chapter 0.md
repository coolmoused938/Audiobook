## Prolouge
For anyone who has wondered what their life might look like at the end of the road not taken.


## Poem

```
What might have been and what has been
Point to one end, which is always present.
Footfalls echo in the memory
Down the passage which we did not take
Towards the door we never opened.
```

—T. S. Eliot, “Burnt Norton”
