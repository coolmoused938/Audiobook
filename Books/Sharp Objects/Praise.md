## Praise

‘To say this is a terrific debut novel is really too mild . . . [it is] a relentlessly creepy family saga. I found myself dreading the last thirty pages or so, but was helpless to stop turning them. Then, after the lights were out, the story just stayed there in my head, coiled and hissing, like a snake in a cave’

Stephen King

‘This is a stylish thriller about housewives who don’t recognise their own desperations, while the reader recognises with fascinated clarity the nastiness and vacuity of life in an updated Stepford’ _Literary Review_

‘It is a stunningly accomplished evocation of the oppressive-ness of small-town life and is just as assured in depicting the gradually revealed psychological disorder that links Camille to both killer and victims’

_Sunday Times_

‘Compulsively disturbing and . . . exciting’

_Time Out_

‘[A] striking first novel . . . a relentlessly dark tale, with some very disturbed characters, Camille among them, and it makes a powerful impact’

_Sunday Telegraph_

‘A stylish and compelling debut. A real winner’

Harlan Coben

‘If you love Martha O’Connor look out for Gillian Flynn’s debut, _Sharp Objects_ . . .

a gothic fairytale-gone-bad’ _Company_

‘The horror creeps up slowly, with Flynn misdirecting the reader until the shocking, dreadful and memorable double ending’

_Publisher’s Weekly_

‘ _Sharp Objects_ is one of the freshest debut thrillers to come around in a long while. It’s a gripping, substantive story, stripped of cliché, and crafted with great style. The characters are refreshingly real, burdened with psychological issues that enrich the story. And the ending, which I was positive I could predict, is unpredictable’

Augusten Burroughs

‘Skillful and disturbing . . . [Flynn] has an unsparing eye for human imperfection and for the evil that moves among us’

_Washington Post_

‘A compulsively readable psychological thriller that marks [a] dazzling debut. . . . [Flynn] has written a clever crime story with astonishing twists and turns, and enough suspense for the most demanding fans of the genre. But it is the sensitive yet disturbing depiction of her heroine that makes this an especially engrossing story. . . . Flynn’s empathic understanding of her major characters leads to storytelling that is sure and true, and it marks her as a writer to watch’

_Chicago Sun-Times_

‘A deeply creepy exploration of small-town Midwestern values . . . boasts one of the most deliciously dysfunctional families to come along in a while. . . . [Flynn] handles the narrative with confidence and a surprisingly high level of skill . . . Wind Gap ends up the sort of place you’d never want to visit. But with _Sharp Objects,_ you’re in no hurry to leave’

_San Francisco Chronicle_

Gillian Flynn is the chief TV critic for _Entertainment Weekly_. This is her first novel.
