#  _In Brief_

Camille Preaker is a reporter in Chicago. Sounds glamorous, but the _Daily Post_ , the fourth largest paper in the city, is a far cry from the _New York Times_. Camille’s editor, Frank Curry, believes that one ‘right’ story will get his paper noticed. When a child disappears in Wind Gap, a town where a girl had been murdered the previous year, Frank smells a serial killer, and who better to get the inside story than Camille, his very own ex-resident of Wind Gap. So Camille has to go home; a journey back to a tragic past, and secrets she _really_ doesn’t want to uncover.

#  _In Detail_

Wind Gap has a population of around 2,000, consisting of ‘Old money and trash’, Camille tells her editor. ‘I’m trash.

From old money,’ she adds.

There aren’t many ties to undo in Chicago, so she is soon heading down to her home town. When she reaches Wind Gap, her paper’s budget dictates that she’ll stay with her mother; a prospect which serves to fill her only with bourbon.

She soon gets to work and talks to a reluctant police Chief Vickery. It turns out that Ann Nash had been strangled the previous August, and dumped in the creek. The search for the missing girl, Natalie Keene, is still ongoing, and Camille joins it in the North Woods. Talking to the townspeople as they search, she learns that the Nash girl had had all her teeth removed by her killer, meaning he must have been ‘some crazy man’ riding through town. Not a local . . . Surely . . .

Camille calls in to the Nash home after leaving the fruitless search and learns more odd things about the killing of Ann. Unusually for this type of crime she was unmolested. ‘No bruises, no cuts, no sign of any kind of . . . torture. Just strangled her. Pried her teeth out.’

Camille has put off going to her childhood home for as long as she possibly can, but the evil moment can be postponed no longer, and she is soon looking at her mother’s ‘massive house . . . an elaborate Victorian replete with a widow’s walk.’ So she is home, with her hypochondriac mother, Adora; but then wouldn’t you be extra careful if your daughter Marian had died in childhood? Is it any wonder that her care of Amma, Camille’s thirteen-year-old half sister, is so smothering?

After a disturbed night, Camille decides to stake out the police station for a quote before the search recommences. As she drives down a near deserted Main Street she sees a small group of people. Why would a middle-aged woman be ‘sitting in the middle of the sidewalk, legs splayed, staring at the side of a building’? As Camille approaches, the horror is revealed.

Camille continues her investigations, and becomes increasingly disturbed by Wind Gap: her sister’s chameleon existence - is she a vamp, or a little girl? Her mother’s seeming isolation from reality; and the inevitable pull back to her own damaged and damaging childhood. She finds a boy who saw a woman in a nightgown snatch Natalie, but no one believes him. As out-of-town detective Richard Willis joins the investigation of the bizarre crimes, Camille starts to put the whole thing together, a puzzle that just gets her skin zinging. An itch that just needs a sharp little scratch . . .

#  _For Discussion_

• ‘Good editors don’t see bark, they see leaves’ What do you think the author means by this when she introduces us to Frank Curry, Camille’s editor?

• ‘The Victorians . . . needed a lot of room to stray away from each other . . . to avoid rapacious lust, to wall themselves away from sticky emotions. Extra space is always good.’ How much does Adora’s home add to the problem? Would a two-room apartment have helped?

• ‘Natalie was buried in the family plot, next to a gravestone that already bore her parents’ names. I know the wisdom, that no parents should see their child die, that such an event is like nature spun backward. But it’s the only way to truly keep your child. Kids grow up, they forge more potent allegiances. They find a spouse or a lover. They will not be buried with you. The Keenes, however, will remain the purest form of family. Underground.’ Macabre but true?

• ‘Outside on the porch I saw a changeling.’ How do you feel about Amma? Is she a changeling in the traditional sense of the word? Or a chameleon forced to adapt to her unnatural environment?

• ‘When you die, you become perfect. I’d be like Princess Diana. Everyone loves her now.’ Is Amma right? Does this apply in the world of Wind Gap? In our lives is this also true?

• Do you think there is any significance to the letter A in _Sharp Objects_? Think of Camille’s family in particular.

• ‘ _I’m here_. I don’t usually feel that I am.’ How has Camille’s past shaped her? Do you agree with her shrinks that her ‘weightlessness’ is due to her ignorance of her history?

• ‘“Oh, now look what you’ve done. I’m bleeding.” My mother held up thorn-pricked hands, and trails of deep red began to roll down her wrists.’ What does this image in Camille’s mind tell us of her view of her mother?

• ‘I jammed a floppy blue teddy bear under my head, then felt guilty and returned him to the foot of the bed. One should have allegiance to one’s childhood things.’ How else does Camille’s allegiance manifest itself? Would she be better without it, or do you agree with her?

• How important do you think the outward appearance of the people in _Sharp Objects_ is to their personalities. Ugliness and beauty are themes throughout the book, but are they the key themes? Or do the characters rise above the visual?

• ‘A ring of perfect skin.’ One on Camille’s back, and another on her mother’s wrist. What significance does this have do you think? How alike are they?

• ‘Sometimes I think illness sits inside every woman, waiting for the right moment to bloom.’ How far do you agree with this? Can you see how Camille has come to think this?
